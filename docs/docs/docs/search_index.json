simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like.\nIn TypeScript, we support much the same types as you would expect in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.\nBoolean\nThe most basic datatype is the simple true/false value, which JavaScript and TypeScript call a boolean value.\nlet isDone: boolean = false;\n\nNumber\nAs in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are floating point values.\nThese floating point numbers get the type number.\nIn addition to hexadecimal and decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\nlet decimal: number = 6;\nlet hex: number = 0xf00d;\nlet binary: number = 0b1010;\nlet octal: number = 0o744;\n\nString\nAnother fundamental part of creating programs in JavaScript for webpages and servers alike is working with textual data.\nAs in other languages, we use the type string to refer to these textual datatypes.\nJust like JavaScript, TypeScript also uses double quotes (\") or single quotes (') to surround string data.\nlet color: string = \"blue\";\ncolor = 'red';\n\nYou can also use template strings, which can span multiple lines and have embedded expressions.\nThese strings are surrounded by the backtick/backquote (` ) character, and embedded expressions are of the form ${ expr }.\nlet fullName: string = `Bob Bobbington`;\nlet age: number = 37;\nlet sentence: string = `Hello, my name is ${ fullName }.\n\nI'll be ${ age + 1 } years old next month.`;\n\nThis is equivalent to declaring sentence like so:\nlet sentence: string = \"Hello, my name is \" + fullName + \".\\n\\n\" +\n    \"I'll be \" + (age + 1) + \" years old next month.\";\n\nArray\nTypeScript, like JavaScript, allows you to work with arrays of values.\nArray types can be written in one of two ways.\nIn the first, you use the type of the elements followed by [] to denote an array of that element type:\nlet list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n\nThe second way uses a generic array type, Array:\nlet list: Array = [1, 2, 3];\n\nTuple\nTuple types allow you to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but need not be the same.\nFor example, you may want to represent a value as a pair of a string and a number:\n// Declare a tuple type\nlet x: [string, number];\n// Initialize it\nx = [\"hello\", 10]; // OK\n// Initialize it incorrectly\nx = [10, \"hello\"]; // Error\n\nWhen accessing an element with a known index, the correct type is retrieved:\nconsole.log(x[0].substr(1)); // OK\nconsole.log(x[1].substr(1)); // Error, 'number' does not have 'substr'\n\nWhen accessing an element outside the set of known indices, a union type is used instead:\nx[3] = \"world\"; // OK, 'string' can be assigned to 'string | number'\n\nconsole.log(x[5].toString()); // OK, 'string' and 'number' both have 'toString'\n\nx[6] = true; // Error, 'boolean' isn't 'string | number'\n\nUnion types are an advanced topic that we'll cover in a later chapter.\nEnum\nA helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from JavaScript is the enum.\nAs in languages like C#, an enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values.\nenum Color {Red, Green, Blue}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\nBy default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0.\nYou can change this by manually setting the value of one of its members.\nFor example, we can start the previous example at 1 instead of 0:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\nOr, even manually set all the values in the enum:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4}\nlet c: Color = Color.Green;\n\nA handy feature of enums is that you can also go from a numeric value to the name of that value in the enum.\nFor example, if we had the value 2 but weren't sure what that mapped to in the Color enum above, we could look up the corresponding name:\nenum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}\nlet colorName: string = Color[2];\n\nconsole.log(colorName); // Displays 'Green' as its value is 2 above\n\nAny\nWe may need to describe the type of variables that we do not know when we are writing an application.\nThese values may come from dynamic content, e.g. from the user or a 3rd party library.\nIn these cases, we want to opt-out of type-checking and let the values pass through compile-time checks.\nTo do so, we label these with the any type:\nlet notSure: any = 4;\nnotSure = \"maybe a string instead\";\nnotSure = false; // okay, definitely a boolean\n\nThe any type is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript, allowing you to gradually opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation.\nYou might expect Object to play a similar role, as it does in other languages.\nBut variables of type Object only allow you to assign any value to them - you can't call arbitrary methods on them, even ones that actually exist:\nlet notSure: any = 4;\nnotSure.ifItExists(); // okay, ifItExists might exist at runtime\nnotSure.toFixed(); // okay, toFixed exists (but the compiler doesn't check)\n\nlet prettySure: Object = 4;\nprettySure.toFixed(); // Error: Property 'toFixed' doesn't exist on type 'Object'.\n\nThe any type is also handy if you know some part of the type, but perhaps not all of it.\nFor example, you may have an array but the array has a mix of different types:\nlet list: any[] = [1, true, \"free\"];\n\nlist[1] = 100;\n\nVoid\nvoid is a little like the opposite of any: the absence of having any type at all.\nYou may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value:\nfunction warnUser(): void {\n    console.log(\"This is my warning message\");\n}\n\nDeclaring variables of type void is not useful because you can only assign undefined or null to them:\nlet unusable: void = undefined;\n\nNull and Undefined\nIn TypeScript, both undefined and null actually have their own types named undefined and null respectively.\nMuch like void, they're not extremely useful on their own:\n// Not much else we can assign to these variables!\nlet u: undefined = undefined;\nlet n: null = null;\n\nBy default null and undefined are subtypes of all other types.\nThat means you can assign null and undefined to something like number.\nHowever, when using the --strictNullChecks flag, null and undefined are only assignable to void and their respective types.\nThis helps avoid many common errors.\nIn cases where you want to pass in either a string or null or undefined, you can use the union type string | null | undefined.\nOnce again, more on union types later on.\n\nAs a note: we encourage the use of --strictNullChecks when possible, but for the purposes of this handbook, we will assume it is turned off.\n\nNever\nThe never type represents the type of values that never occur.\nFor instance, never is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns;\nVariables also acquire the type never when narrowed by any type guards that can never be true.\nThe never type is a subtype of, and assignable to, every type; however, no type is a subtype of, or assignable to, never (except never itself).\nEven any isn't assignable to never.\nSome examples of functions returning never:\n// Function returning never must have unreachable end point\nfunction error(message: string): never {\n    throw new Error(message);\n}\n\n// Inferred return type is never\nfunction fail() {\n    return error(\"Something failed\");\n}\n\n// Function returning never must have unreachable end point\nfunction infiniteLoop(): never {\n    while (true) {\n    }\n}\n\nObject\nobject is a type that represents the non-primitive type, i.e. any thing that is not number, string, boolean, symbol, null, or undefined.\nWith object type, APIs like Object.create can be better represented. For example:\ndeclare function create(o: object | null): void;\n\ncreate({ prop: 0 }); // OK\ncreate(null); // OK\n\ncreate(42); // Error\ncreate(\"string\"); // Error\ncreate(false); // Error\ncreate(undefined); // Error\n\nType assertions\nSometimes you'll end up in a situation where you'll know more about a value than TypeScript does.\nUsually this will happen when you know the type of some entity could be more specific than its current type.\nType assertions are a way to tell the compiler \"trust me, I know what I'm doing.\"\nA type assertion is like a type cast in other languages, but performs no special checking or restructuring of data.\nIt has no runtime impact, and is used purely by the compiler.\nTypeScript assumes that you, the programmer, have performed any special checks that you need.\nType assertions have two forms.\nOne is the \"angle-bracket\" syntax:\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue).length;\n\nAnd the other is the as-syntax:\nlet someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n\nlet strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;\n\nThe two samples are equivalent.\nUsing one over the other is mostly a choice of preference; however, when using TypeScript with JSX, only as-style assertions are allowed.\nA note about let\nYou may've noticed that so far, we've been using the let keyword instead of JavaScript's var keyword which you might be more familiar with.\nThe let keyword is actually a newer JavaScript construct that TypeScript makes available.\nWe'll discuss the details later, but many common problems in JavaScript are alleviated by using let, so you should use it instead of var whenever possible.\n"},"pages/Variable Declarations.html":{"url":"pages/Variable Declarations.html","title":"Variable Declarations","keywords":"","body":"Variable Declarations\nlet and const are two relatively new types of variable declarations in JavaScript.\nAs we mentioned earlier, let is similar to var in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common \"gotchas\" that users run into in JavaScript.\nconst is an augmentation of let in that it prevents re-assignment to a variable.\nWith TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript, the language naturally supports let and const.\nHere we'll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they're preferable to var.\nIf you've used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your memory.\nIf you're intimately familiar with all the quirks of var declarations in JavaScript, you might find it easier to skip ahead.\nvar declarations\nDeclaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the var keyword.\nvar a = 10;\n\nAs you might've figured out, we just declared a variable named a with the value 10.\nWe can also declare a variable inside of a function:\nfunction f() {\n    var message = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n    return message;\n}\n\nand we can also access those same variables within other functions:\nfunction f() {\n    var a = 10;\n    return function g() {\n        var b = a + 1;\n        return b;\n    }\n}\n\nvar g = f();\ng(); // returns '11'\n\nIn this above example, g captured the variable a declared in f.\nAt any point that g gets called, the value of a will be tied to the value of a in f.\nEven if g is called once f is done running, it will be able to access and modify a.\nfunction f() {\n    var a = 1;\n\n    a = 2;\n    var b = g();\n    a = 3;\n\n    return b;\n\n    function g() {\n        return a;\n    }\n}\n\nf(); // returns '2'\n\nScoping rules\nvar declarations have some odd scoping rules for those used to other languages.\nTake the following example:\nfunction f(shouldInitialize: boolean) {\n    if (shouldInitialize) {\n        var x = 10;\n    }\n\n    return x;\n}\n\nf(true);  // returns '10'\nf(false); // returns 'undefined'\n\nSome readers might do a double-take at this example.\nThe variable x was declared within the if block, and yet we were able to access it from outside that block.\nThat's because var declarations are accessible anywhere within their containing function, module, namespace, or global scope - all which we'll go over later on - regardless of the containing block.\nSome people call this var-scoping or function-scoping.\nParameters are also function scoped.\nThese scoping rules can cause several types of mistakes.\nOne problem they exacerbate is the fact that it is not an error to declare the same variable multiple times:\nfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {\n    var sum = 0;\n    for (var i = 0; i \nMaybe it was easy to spot out for some, but the inner for-loop will accidentally overwrite the variable i because i refers to the same function-scoped variable.\nAs experienced developers know by now, similar sorts of bugs slip through code reviews and can be an endless source of frustration.\nVariable capturing quirks\nTake a quick second to guess what the output of the following snippet is:\nfor (var i = 0; i \nFor those unfamiliar, setTimeout will try to execute a function after a certain number of milliseconds (though waiting for anything else to stop running).\nReady? Take a look:\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nMany JavaScript developers are intimately familiar with this behavior, but if you're surprised, you're certainly not alone.\nMost people expect the output to be\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nRemember what we mentioned earlier about variable capturing?\nEvery function expression we pass to setTimeout actually refers to the same i from the same scope.\nLet's take a minute to consider what that means.\nsetTimeout will run a function after some number of milliseconds, but only after the for loop has stopped executing;\nBy the time the for loop has stopped executing, the value of i is 10.\nSo each time the given function gets called, it will print out 10!\nA common work around is to use an IIFE - an Immediately Invoked Function Expression - to capture i at each iteration:\nfor (var i = 0; i \nThis odd-looking pattern is actually pretty common.\nThe i in the parameter list actually shadows the i declared in the for loop, but since we named them the same, we didn't have to modify the loop body too much.\nlet declarations\nBy now you've figured out that var has some problems, which is precisely why let statements were introduced.\nApart from the keyword used, let statements are written the same way var statements are.\nlet hello = \"Hello!\";\n\nThe key difference is not in the syntax, but in the semantics, which we'll now dive into.\nBlock-scoping\nWhen a variable is declared using let, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or block-scoping.\nUnlike variables declared with var whose scopes leak out to their containing function, block-scoped variables are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or for-loop.\nfunction f(input: boolean) {\n    let a = 100;\n\n    if (input) {\n        // Still okay to reference 'a'\n        let b = a + 1;\n        return b;\n    }\n\n    // Error: 'b' doesn't exist here\n    return b;\n}\n\nHere, we have two local variables a and b.\na's scope is limited to the body of f while b's scope is limited to the containing if statement's block.\nVariables declared in a catch clause also have similar scoping rules.\ntry {\n    throw \"oh no!\";\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    console.log(\"Oh well.\");\n}\n\n// Error: 'e' doesn't exist here\nconsole.log(e);\n\nAnother property of block-scoped variables is that they can't be read or written to before they're actually declared.\nWhile these variables are \"present\" throughout their scope, all points up until their declaration are part of their temporal dead zone.\nThis is just a sophisticated way of saying you can't access them before the let statement, and luckily TypeScript will let you know that.\na++; // illegal to use 'a' before it's declared;\nlet a;\n\nSomething to note is that you can still capture a block-scoped variable before it's declared.\nThe only catch is that it's illegal to call that function before the declaration.\nIf targeting ES2015, a modern runtime will throw an error; however, right now TypeScript is permissive and won't report this as an error.\nfunction foo() {\n    // okay to capture 'a'\n    return a;\n}\n\n// illegal call 'foo' before 'a' is declared\n// runtimes should throw an error here\nfoo();\n\nlet a;\n\nFor more information on temporal dead zones, see relevant content on the Mozilla Developer Network.\nRe-declarations and Shadowing\nWith var declarations, we mentioned that it didn't matter how many times you declared your variables; you just got one.\nfunction f(x) {\n    var x;\n    var x;\n\n    if (true) {\n        var x;\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above example, all declarations of x actually refer to the same x, and this is perfectly valid.\nThis often ends up being a source of bugs.\nThankfully, let declarations are not as forgiving.\nlet x = 10;\nlet x = 20; // error: can't re-declare 'x' in the same scope\n\nThe variables don't necessarily need to both be block-scoped for TypeScript to tell us that there's a problem.\nfunction f(x) {\n    let x = 100; // error: interferes with parameter declaration\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    let x = 100;\n    var x = 100; // error: can't have both declarations of 'x'\n}\n\nThat's not to say that block-scoped variable can never be declared with a function-scoped variable.\nThe block-scoped variable just needs to be declared within a distinctly different block.\nfunction f(condition, x) {\n    if (condition) {\n        let x = 100;\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    return x;\n}\n\nf(false, 0); // returns '0'\nf(true, 0);  // returns '100'\n\nThe act of introducing a new name in a more nested scope is called shadowing.\nIt is a bit of a double-edged sword in that it can introduce certain bugs on its own in the event of accidental shadowing, while also preventing certain bugs.\nFor instance, imagine we had written our earlier sumMatrix function using let variables.\nfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i \nThis version of the loop will actually perform the summation correctly because the inner loop's i shadows i from the outer loop.\nShadowing should usually be avoided in the interest of writing clearer code.\nWhile there are some scenarios where it may be fitting to take advantage of it, you should use your best judgement.\nBlock-scoped variable capturing\nWhen we first touched on the idea of variable capturing with var declaration, we briefly went into how variables act once captured.\nTo give a better intuition of this, each time a scope is run, it creates an \"environment\" of variables.\nThat environment and its captured variables can exist even after everything within its scope has finished executing.\nfunction theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {\n    let getCity;\n\n    if (true) {\n        let city = \"Seattle\";\n        getCity = function() {\n            return city;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return getCity();\n}\n\nBecause we've captured city from within its environment, we're still able to access it despite the fact that the if block finished executing.\nRecall that with our earlier setTimeout example, we ended up needing to use an IIFE to capture the state of a variable for every iteration of the for loop.\nIn effect, what we were doing was creating a new variable environment for our captured variables.\nThat was a bit of a pain, but luckily, you'll never have to do that again in TypeScript.\nlet declarations have drastically different behavior when declared as part of a loop.\nRather than just introducing a new environment to the loop itself, these declarations sort of create a new scope per iteration.\nSince this is what we were doing anyway with our IIFE, we can change our old setTimeout example to just use a let declaration.\nfor (let i = 0; i \nand as expected, this will print out\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nconst declarations\nconst declarations are another way of declaring variables.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\n\nThey are like let declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed once they are bound.\nIn other words, they have the same scoping rules as let, but you can't re-assign to them.\nThis should not be confused with the idea that the values they refer to are immutable.\nconst numLivesForCat = 9;\nconst kitty = {\n    name: \"Aurora\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat,\n}\n\n// Error\nkitty = {\n    name: \"Danielle\",\n    numLives: numLivesForCat\n};\n\n// all \"okay\"\nkitty.name = \"Rory\";\nkitty.name = \"Kitty\";\nkitty.name = \"Cat\";\nkitty.numLives--;\n\nUnless you take specific measures to avoid it, the internal state of a const variable is still modifiable.\nFortunately, TypeScript allows you to specify that members of an object are readonly.\nThe chapter on Interfaces has the details.\nlet vs. const\nGiven that we have two types of declarations with similar scoping semantics, it's natural to find ourselves asking which one to use.\nLike most broad questions, the answer is: it depends.\nApplying the principle of least privilege, all declarations other than those you plan to modify should use const.\nThe rationale is that if a variable didn't need to get written to, others working on the same codebase shouldn't automatically be able to write to the object, and will need to consider whether they really need to reassign to the variable.\nUsing const also makes code more predictable when reasoning about flow of data.\nUse your best judgement, and if applicable, consult the matter with the rest of your team.\nThe majority of this handbook uses let declarations.\nDestructuring\nAnother ECMAScript 2015 feature that TypeScript has is destructuring.\nFor a complete reference, see the article on the Mozilla Developer Network.\nIn this section, we'll give a short overview.\nArray destructuring\nThe simplest form of destructuring is array destructuring assignment:\nlet input = [1, 2];\nlet [first, second] = input;\nconsole.log(first); // outputs 1\nconsole.log(second); // outputs 2\n\nThis creates two new variables named first and second.\nThis is equivalent to using indexing, but is much more convenient:\nfirst = input[0];\nsecond = input[1];\n\nDestructuring works with already-declared variables as well:\n// swap variables\n[first, second] = [second, first];\n\nAnd with parameters to a function:\nfunction f([first, second]: [number, number]) {\n    console.log(first);\n    console.log(second);\n}\nf([1, 2]);\n\nYou can create a variable for the remaining items in a list using the syntax ...:\nlet [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // outputs 1\nconsole.log(rest); // outputs [ 2, 3, 4 ]\n\nOf course, since this is JavaScript, you can just ignore trailing elements you don't care about:\nlet [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(first); // outputs 1\n\nOr other elements:\nlet [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nObject destructuring\nYou can also destructure objects:\nlet o = {\n    a: \"foo\",\n    b: 12,\n    c: \"bar\"\n};\nlet { a, b } = o;\n\nThis creates new variables a and b from o.a and o.b.\nNotice that you can skip c if you don't need it.\nLike array destructuring, you can have assignment without declaration:\n({ a, b } = { a: \"baz\", b: 101 });\n\nNotice that we had to surround this statement with parentheses.\nJavaScript normally parses a { as the start of block.\nYou can create a variable for the remaining items in an object using the syntax ...:\nlet { a, ...passthrough } = o;\nlet total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;\n\nProperty renaming\nYou can also give different names to properties:\nlet { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;\n\nHere the syntax starts to get confusing.\nYou can read a: newName1 as \"a as newName1\".\nThe direction is left-to-right, as if you had written:\nlet newName1 = o.a;\nlet newName2 = o.b;\n\nConfusingly, the colon here does not indicate the type.\nThe type, if you specify it, still needs to be written after the entire destructuring:\nlet { a, b }: { a: string, b: number } = o;\n\nDefault values\nDefault values let you specify a default value in case a property is undefined:\nfunction keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string, b?: number }) {\n    let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;\n}\n\nkeepWholeObject now has a variable for wholeObject as well as the properties a and b, even if b is undefined.\nFunction declarations\nDestructuring also works in function declarations.\nFor simple cases this is straightforward:\ntype C = { a: string, b?: number }\nfunction f({ a, b }: C): void {\n    // ...\n}\n\nBut specifying defaults is more common for parameters, and getting defaults right with destructuring can be tricky.\nFirst of all, you need to remember to put the pattern before the default value.\nfunction f({ a=\"\", b=0 } = {}): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf();\n\n\nThe snippet above is an example of type inference, explained later in the handbook.\n\nThen, you need to remember to give a default for optional properties on the destructured property instead of the main initializer.\nRemember that C was defined with b optional:\nfunction f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: \"\" }): void {\n    // ...\n}\nf({ a: \"yes\" }); // ok, default b = 0\nf(); // ok, default to { a: \"\" }, which then defaults b = 0\nf({}); // error, 'a' is required if you supply an argument\n\nUse destructuring with care.\nAs the previous example demonstrates, anything but the simplest destructuring expression is confusing.\nThis is especially true with deeply nested destructuring, which gets really hard to understand even without piling on renaming, default values, and type annotations.\nTry to keep destructuring expressions small and simple.\nYou can always write the assignments that destructuring would generate yourself.\nSpread\nThe spread operator is the opposite of destructuring.\nIt allows you to spread an array into another array, or an object into another object.\nFor example:\nlet first = [1, 2];\nlet second = [3, 4];\nlet bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];\n\nThis gives bothPlus the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nSpreading creates a shallow copy of first and second.\nThey are not changed by the spread.\nYou can also spread objects:\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { ...defaults, food: \"rich\" };\n\nNow search is { food: \"rich\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" }.\nObject spreading is more complex than array spreading.\nLike array spreading, it proceeds from left-to-right, but the result is still an object.\nThis means that properties that come later in the spread object overwrite properties that come earlier.\nSo if we modify the previous example to spread at the end:\nlet defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" };\nlet search = { food: \"rich\", ...defaults };\n\nThen the food property in defaults overwrites food: \"rich\", which is not what we want in this case.\nObject spread also has a couple of other surprising limits.\nFirst, it only includes an objects'\nown, enumerable properties.\nBasically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:\nclass C {\n  p = 12;\n  m() {\n  }\n}\nlet c = new C();\nlet clone = { ...c };\nclone.p; // ok\nclone.m(); // error!\n\nSecond, the Typescript compiler doesn't allow spreads of type parameters from generic functions.\nThat feature is expected in future versions of the language.\n"},"pages/Interfaces.html":{"url":"pages/Interfaces.html","title":"Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nOne of TypeScript's core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have.\nThis is sometimes called \"duck typing\" or \"structural subtyping\".\nIn TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.\nOur First Interface\nThe easiest way to see how interfaces work is to start with a simple example:\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: { label: string }) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\nThe type-checker checks the call to printLabel.\nThe printLabel function has a single parameter that requires that the object passed in has a property called label of type string.\nNotice that our object actually has more properties than this, but the compiler only checks that at least the ones required are present and match the types required.\nThere are some cases where TypeScript isn't as lenient, which we'll cover in a bit.\nWe can write the same example again, this time using an interface to describe the requirement of having the label property that is a string:\ninterface LabelledValue {\n    label: string;\n}\n\nfunction printLabel(labelledObj: LabelledValue) {\n    console.log(labelledObj.label);\n}\n\nlet myObj = {size: 10, label: \"Size 10 Object\"};\nprintLabel(myObj);\n\nThe interface LabelledValue is a name we can now use to describe the requirement in the previous example.\nIt still represents having a single property called label that is of type string.\nNotice we didn't have to explicitly say that the object we pass to printLabel implements this interface like we might have to in other languages.\nHere, it's only the shape that matters. If the object we pass to the function meets the requirements listed, then it's allowed.\nIt's worth pointing out that the type-checker does not require that these properties come in any sort of order, only that the properties the interface requires are present and have the required type.\nOptional Properties\nNot all properties of an interface may be required.\nSome exist under certain conditions or may not be there at all.\nThese optional properties are popular when creating patterns like \"option bags\" where you pass an object to a function that only has a couple of properties filled in.\nHere's an example of this pattern:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): {color: string; area: number} {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.color) {\n        newSquare.color = config.color;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\nInterfaces with optional properties are written similar to other interfaces, with each optional property denoted by a ? at the end of the property name in the declaration.\nThe advantage of optional properties is that you can describe these possibly available properties while still also preventing use of properties that are not part of the interface.\nFor example, had we mistyped the name of the color property in createSquare, we would get an error message letting us know:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    let newSquare = {color: \"white\", area: 100};\n    if (config.clor) {\n        // Error: Property 'clor' does not exist on type 'SquareConfig'\n        newSquare.color = config.clor;\n    }\n    if (config.width) {\n        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;\n    }\n    return newSquare;\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({color: \"black\"});\n\nReadonly properties\nSome properties should only be modifiable when an object is first created.\nYou can specify this by putting readonly before the name of the property:\ninterface Point {\n    readonly x: number;\n    readonly y: number;\n}\n\nYou can construct a Point by assigning an object literal.\nAfter the assignment, x and y can't be changed.\nlet p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };\np1.x = 5; // error!\n\nTypeScript comes with a ReadonlyArray type that is the same as Array with all mutating methods removed, so you can make sure you don't change your arrays after creation:\nlet a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nlet ro: ReadonlyArray = a;\nro[0] = 12; // error!\nro.push(5); // error!\nro.length = 100; // error!\na = ro; // error!\n\nOn the last line of the snippet you can see that even assigning the entire ReadonlyArray back to a normal array is illegal.\nYou can still override it with a type assertion, though:\na = ro as number[];\n\nreadonly vs const\nThe easiest way to remember whether to use readonly or const is to ask whether you're using it on a variable or a property.\nVariables use const whereas properties use readonly.\nExcess Property Checks\nIn our first example using interfaces, TypeScript lets us pass { size: number; label: string; } to something that only expected a { label: string; }.\nWe also just learned about optional properties, and how they're useful when describing so-called \"option bags\".\nHowever, combining the two naively would let you to shoot yourself in the foot the same way you might in JavaScript.\nFor example, taking our last example using createSquare:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n}\n\nfunction createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\nNotice the given argument to createSquare is spelled colour instead of color.\nIn plain JavaScript, this sort of thing fails silently.\nYou could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the width properties are compatible, there's no color property present, and the extra colour property is insignificant.\nHowever, TypeScript takes the stance that there's probably a bug in this code.\nObject literals get special treatment and undergo excess property checking when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments.\nIf an object literal has any properties that the \"target type\" doesn't have, you'll get an error.\n// error: 'colour' not expected in type 'SquareConfig'\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: \"red\", width: 100 });\n\nGetting around these checks is actually really simple.\nThe easiest method is to just use a type assertion:\nlet mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);\n\nHowever, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you're sure that the object can have some extra properties that are used in some special way.\nIf SquareConfig can have color and width properties with the above types, but could also have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:\ninterface SquareConfig {\n    color?: string;\n    width?: number;\n    [propName: string]: any;\n}\n\nWe'll discuss index signatures in a bit, but here we're saying a SquareConfig can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren't color or width, their types don't matter.\nOne final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable:\nSince squareOptions won't undergo excess property checks, the compiler won't give you an error.\nlet squareOptions = { colour: \"red\", width: 100 };\nlet mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);\n\nKeep in mind that for simple code like above, you probably shouldn't be trying to \"get around\" these checks.\nFor more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.\nThat means if you're running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to revise some of your type declarations.\nIn this instance, if it's okay to pass an object with both a color or colour property to createSquare, you should fix up the definition of SquareConfig to reflect that.\nFunction Types\nInterfaces are capable of describing the wide range of shapes that JavaScript objects can take.\nIn addition to describing an object with properties, interfaces are also capable of describing function types.\nTo describe a function type with an interface, we give the interface a call signature.\nThis is like a function declaration with only the parameter list and return type given. Each parameter in the parameter list requires both name and type.\ninterface SearchFunc {\n    (source: string, subString: string): boolean;\n}\n\nOnce defined, we can use this function type interface like we would other interfaces.\nHere, we show how you can create a variable of a function type and assign it a function value of the same type.\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(source: string, subString: string) {\n    let result = source.search(subString);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\nFor function types to correctly type-check, the names of the parameters do not need to match.\nWe could have, for example, written the above example like this:\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src: string, sub: string): boolean {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\nFunction parameters are checked one at a time, with the type in each corresponding parameter position checked against each other.\nIf you do not want to specify types at all, TypeScript's contextual typing can infer the argument types since the function value is assigned directly to a variable of type SearchFunc.\nHere, also, the return type of our function expression is implied by the values it returns (here false and true).\nHad the function expression returned numbers or strings, the type-checker would have warned us that return type doesn't match the return type described in the SearchFunc interface.\nlet mySearch: SearchFunc;\nmySearch = function(src, sub) {\n    let result = src.search(sub);\n    return result > -1;\n}\n\nIndexable Types\nSimilarly to how we can use interfaces to describe function types, we can also describe types that we can \"index into\" like a[10], or ageMap[\"daniel\"].\nIndexable types have an index signature that describes the types we can use to index into the object, along with the corresponding return types when indexing.\nLet's take an example:\ninterface StringArray {\n    [index: number]: string;\n}\n\nlet myArray: StringArray;\nmyArray = [\"Bob\", \"Fred\"];\n\nlet myStr: string = myArray[0];\n\nAbove, we have a StringArray interface that has an index signature.\nThis index signature states that when a StringArray is indexed with a number, it will return a string.\nThere are two types of supported index signatures: string and number.\nIt is possible to support both types of indexers, but the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer.\nThis is because when indexing with a number, JavaScript will actually convert that to a string before indexing into an object.\nThat means that indexing with 100 (a number) is the same thing as indexing with \"100\" (a string), so the two need to be consistent.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n}\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    breed: string;\n}\n\n// Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!\ninterface NotOkay {\n    [x: number]: Animal;\n    [x: string]: Dog;\n}\n\nWhile string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the \"dictionary\" pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type.\nThis is because a string index declares that obj.property is also available as obj[\"property\"].\nIn the following example, name's type does not match the string index's type, and the type-checker gives an error:\ninterface NumberDictionary {\n    [index: string]: number;\n    length: number;    // ok, length is a number\n    name: string;      // error, the type of 'name' is not a subtype of the indexer\n}\n\nFinally, you can make index signatures readonly in order to prevent assignment to their indices:\ninterface ReadonlyStringArray {\n    readonly [index: number]: string;\n}\nlet myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"];\nmyArray[2] = \"Mallory\"; // error!\n\nYou can't set myArray[2] because the index signature is readonly.\nClass Types\nImplementing an interface\nOne of the most common uses of interfaces in languages like C# and Java, that of explicitly enforcing that a class meets a particular contract, is also possible in TypeScript.\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\nYou can also describe methods in an interface that are implemented in the class, as we do with setTime in the below example:\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockInterface {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    setTime(d: Date) {\n        this.currentTime = d;\n    }\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\nInterfaces describe the public side of the class, rather than both the public and private side.\nThis prohibits you from using them to check that a class also has particular types for the private side of the class instance.\nDifference between the static and instance sides of classes\nWhen working with classes and interfaces, it helps to keep in mind that a class has two types: the type of the static side and the type of the instance side.\nYou may notice that if you create an interface with a construct signature and try to create a class that implements this interface you get an error:\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number);\n}\n\nclass Clock implements ClockConstructor {\n    currentTime: Date;\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n}\n\nThis is because when a class implements an interface, only the instance side of the class is checked.\nSince the constructor sits in the static side, it is not included in this check.\nInstead, you would need to work with the static side of the class directly.\nIn this example, we define two interfaces, ClockConstructor for the constructor and ClockInterface for the instance methods.\nThen for convenience we define a constructor function createClock that creates instances of the type that is passed to it.\ninterface ClockConstructor {\n    new (hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface;\n}\ninterface ClockInterface {\n    tick();\n}\n\nfunction createClock(ctor: ClockConstructor, hour: number, minute: number): ClockInterface {\n    return new ctor(hour, minute);\n}\n\nclass DigitalClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"beep beep\");\n    }\n}\nclass AnalogClock implements ClockInterface {\n    constructor(h: number, m: number) { }\n    tick() {\n        console.log(\"tick tock\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet digital = createClock(DigitalClock, 12, 17);\nlet analog = createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32);\n\nBecause createClock's first parameter is of type ClockConstructor, in createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32), it checks that AnalogClock has the correct constructor signature.\nExtending Interfaces\nLike classes, interfaces can extend each other.\nThis allows you to copy the members of one interface into another, which gives you more flexibility in how you separate your interfaces into reusable components.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\n\nAn interface can extend multiple interfaces, creating a combination of all of the interfaces.\ninterface Shape {\n    color: string;\n}\n\ninterface PenStroke {\n    penWidth: number;\n}\n\ninterface Square extends Shape, PenStroke {\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet square = {};\nsquare.color = \"blue\";\nsquare.sideLength = 10;\nsquare.penWidth = 5.0;\n\nHybrid Types\nAs we mentioned earlier, interfaces can describe the rich types present in real world JavaScript.\nBecause of JavaScript's dynamic and flexible nature, you may occasionally encounter an object that works as a combination of some of the types described above.\nOne such example is an object that acts as both a function and an object, with additional properties:\ninterface Counter {\n    (start: number): string;\n    interval: number;\n    reset(): void;\n}\n\nfunction getCounter(): Counter {\n    let counter = function (start: number) { };\n    counter.interval = 123;\n    counter.reset = function () { };\n    return counter;\n}\n\nlet c = getCounter();\nc(10);\nc.reset();\nc.interval = 5.0;\n\nWhen interacting with 3rd-party JavaScript, you may need to use patterns like the above to fully describe the shape of the type.\nInterfaces Extending Classes\nWhen an interface type extends a class type it inherits the members of the class but not their implementations.\nIt is as if the interface had declared all of the members of the class without providing an implementation.\nInterfaces inherit even the private and protected members of a base class.\nThis means that when you create an interface that extends a class with private or protected members, that interface type can only be implemented by that class or a subclass of it.\nThis is useful when you have a large inheritance hierarchy, but want to specify that your code works with only subclasses that have certain properties.\nThe subclasses don't have to be related besides inheriting from the base class.\nFor example:\nclass Control {\n    private state: any;\n}\n\ninterface SelectableControl extends Control {\n    select(): void;\n}\n\nclass Button extends Control implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass TextBox extends Control {\n    select() { }\n}\n\n// Error: Property 'state' is missing in type 'Image'.\nclass Image implements SelectableControl {\n    select() { }\n}\n\nclass Location {\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, SelectableControl contains all of the members of Control, including the private state property.\nSince state is a private member it is only possible for descendants of Control to implement SelectableControl.\nThis is because only descendants of Control will have a state private member that originates in the same declaration, which is a requirement for private members to be compatible.\nWithin the Control class it is possible to access the state private member through an instance of SelectableControl.\nEffectively, a SelectableControl acts like a Control that is known to have a select method.\nThe Button and TextBox classes are subtypes of SelectableControl (because they both inherit from Control and have a select method), but the Image and Location classes are not.\n"},"pages/Classes.html":{"url":"pages/Classes.html","title":"Classes","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nTraditional JavaScript uses functions and prototype-based inheritance to build up reusable components, but this may feel a bit awkward to programmers more comfortable with an object-oriented approach, where classes inherit functionality and objects are built from these classes.\nStarting with ECMAScript 2015, also known as ECMAScript 6, JavaScript programmers will be able to build their applications using this object-oriented class-based approach.\nIn TypeScript, we allow developers to use these techniques now, and compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, without having to wait for the next version of JavaScript.\nClasses\nLet's take a look at a simple class-based example:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\n\nThe syntax should look familiar if you've used C# or Java before.\nWe declare a new class Greeter. This class has three members: a property called greeting, a constructor, and a method greet.\nYou'll notice that in the class when we refer to one of the members of the class we prepend this..\nThis denotes that it's a member access.\nIn the last line we construct an instance of the Greeter class using new.\nThis calls into the constructor we defined earlier, creating a new object with the Greeter shape, and running the constructor to initialize it.\nInheritance\nIn TypeScript, we can use common object-oriented patterns.\nOne of the most fundamental patterns in class-based programming is being able to extend existing classes to create new ones using inheritance.\nLet's take a look at an example:\nclass Animal {\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    bark() {\n        console.log('Woof! Woof!');\n    }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog();\ndog.bark();\ndog.move(10);\ndog.bark();\n\nThis example shows the most basic inheritance feature: classes inherit properties and methods from base classes.\nHere, Dog is a derived class that derives from the Animal base class using the extends keyword.\nDerived classes are often called subclasses, and base classes are often called superclasses.\nBecause Dog extends the functionality from Animal, we were able to create an instance of Dog that could both bark() and move().\nLet's now look at a more complex example.\nclass Animal {\n    name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Snake extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 5) {\n        console.log(\"Slithering...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Horse extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move(distanceInMeters = 45) {\n        console.log(\"Galloping...\");\n        super.move(distanceInMeters);\n    }\n}\n\nlet sam = new Snake(\"Sammy the Python\");\nlet tom: Animal = new Horse(\"Tommy the Palomino\");\n\nsam.move();\ntom.move(34);\n\nThis example covers a few other features we didn't previously mention.\nAgain, we see the extends keywords used to create two new subclasses of Animal: Horse and Snake.\nOne difference from the prior example is that each derived class that contains a constructor function must call super() which will execute the constructor of the base class.\nWhat's more, before we ever access a property on this in a constructor body, we have to call super().\nThis is an important rule that TypeScript will enforce.\nThe example also shows how to override methods in the base class with methods that are specialized for the subclass.\nHere both Snake and Horse create a move method that overrides the move from Animal, giving it functionality specific to each class.\nNote that even though tom is declared as an Animal, since its value is a Horse, calling tom.move(34) will call the overriding method in Horse:\nSlithering...\nSammy the Python moved 5m.\nGalloping...\nTommy the Palomino moved 34m.\n\nPublic, private, and protected modifiers\nPublic by default\nIn our examples, we've been able to freely access the members that we declared throughout our programs.\nIf you're familiar with classes in other languages, you may have noticed in the above examples we haven't had to use the word public to accomplish this; for instance, C# requires that each member be explicitly labeled public to be visible.\nIn TypeScript, each member is public by default.\nYou may still mark a member public explicitly.\nWe could have written the Animal class from the previous section in the following way:\nclass Animal {\n    public name: string;\n    public constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n    public move(distanceInMeters: number) {\n        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);\n    }\n}\n\nUnderstanding private\nWhen a member is marked private, it cannot be accessed from outside of its containing class. For example:\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nnew Animal(\"Cat\").name; // Error: 'name' is private;\n\nTypeScript is a structural type system.\nWhen we compare two different types, regardless of where they came from, if the types of all members are compatible, then we say the types themselves are compatible.\nHowever, when comparing types that have private and protected members, we treat these types differently.\nFor two types to be considered compatible, if one of them has a private member, then the other must have a private member that originated in the same declaration.\nThe same applies to protected members.\nLet's look at an example to better see how this plays out in practice:\nclass Animal {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nclass Rhino extends Animal {\n    constructor() { super(\"Rhino\"); }\n}\n\nclass Employee {\n    private name: string;\n    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\nlet animal = new Animal(\"Goat\");\nlet rhino = new Rhino();\nlet employee = new Employee(\"Bob\");\n\nanimal = rhino;\nanimal = employee; // Error: 'Animal' and 'Employee' are not compatible\n\nIn this example, we have an Animal and a Rhino, with Rhino being a subclass of Animal.\nWe also have a new class Employee that looks identical to Animal in terms of shape.\nWe create some instances of these classes and then try to assign them to each other to see what will happen.\nBecause Animal and Rhino share the private side of their shape from the same declaration of private name: string in Animal, they are compatible. However, this is not the case for Employee.\nWhen we try to assign from an Employee to Animal we get an error that these types are not compatible.\nEven though Employee also has a private member called name, it's not the one we declared in Animal.\nUnderstanding protected\nThe protected modifier acts much like the private modifier with the exception that members declared protected can also be accessed within deriving classes. For example,\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; }\n}\n\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nconsole.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());\nconsole.log(howard.name); // error\n\nNotice that while we can't use name from outside of Person, we can still use it from within an instance method of Employee because Employee derives from Person.\nA constructor may also be marked protected.\nThis means that the class cannot be instantiated outside of its containing class, but can be extended. For example,\nclass Person {\n    protected name: string;\n    protected constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }\n}\n\n// Employee can extend Person\nclass Employee extends Person {\n    private department: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string, department: string) {\n        super(name);\n        this.department = department;\n    }\n\n    public getElevatorPitch() {\n        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;\n    }\n}\n\nlet howard = new Employee(\"Howard\", \"Sales\");\nlet john = new Person(\"John\"); // Error: The 'Person' constructor is protected\n\nReadonly modifier\nYou can make properties readonly by using the readonly keyword.\nReadonly properties must be initialized at their declaration or in the constructor.\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor (theName: string) {\n        this.name = theName;\n    }\n}\nlet dad = new Octopus(\"Man with the 8 strong legs\");\ndad.name = \"Man with the 3-piece suit\"; // error! name is readonly.\n\nParameter properties\nIn our last example, we had to declare a readonly member name and a constructor parameter theName in the Octopus class, and we then immediately set name to theName.\nThis turns out to be a very common practice.\nParameter properties let you create and initialize a member in one place.\nHere's a further revision of the previous Octopus class using a parameter property:\nclass Octopus {\n    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;\n    constructor(readonly name: string) {\n    }\n}\n\nNotice how we dropped theName altogether and just use the shortened readonly name: string parameter on the constructor to create and initialize the name member.\nWe've consolidated the declarations and assignment into one location.\nParameter properties are declared by prefixing a constructor parameter with an accessibility modifier or readonly, or both.\nUsing private for a parameter property declares and initializes a private member; likewise, the same is done for public, protected, and readonly.\nAccessors\nTypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accesses to a member of an object.\nThis gives you a way of having finer-grained control over how a member is accessed on each object.\nLet's convert a simple class to use get and set.\nFirst, let's start with an example without getters and setters.\nclass Employee {\n    fullName: string;\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\nWhile allowing people to randomly set fullName directly is pretty handy, this might get us in trouble if people can change names on a whim.\nIn this version, we check to make sure the user has a secret passcode available before we allow them to modify the employee.\nWe do this by replacing the direct access to fullName with a set that will check the passcode.\nWe add a corresponding get to allow the previous example to continue to work seamlessly.\nlet passcode = \"secret passcode\";\n\nclass Employee {\n    private _fullName: string;\n\n    get fullName(): string {\n        return this._fullName;\n    }\n\n    set fullName(newName: string) {\n        if (passcode && passcode == \"secret passcode\") {\n            this._fullName = newName;\n        }\n        else {\n            console.log(\"Error: Unauthorized update of employee!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet employee = new Employee();\nemployee.fullName = \"Bob Smith\";\nif (employee.fullName) {\n    console.log(employee.fullName);\n}\n\nTo prove to ourselves that our accessor is now checking the passcode, we can modify the passcode and see that when it doesn't match we instead get the message warning us we don't have access to update the employee.\nA couple of things to note about accessors:\nFirst, accessors require you to set the compiler to output ECMAScript 5 or higher.\nDownlevelling to ECMAScript 3 is not supported.\nSecond, accessors with a get and no set are automatically inferred to be readonly.\nThis is helpful when generating a .d.ts file from your code, because users of your property can see that they can't change it.\nStatic Properties\nUp to this point, we've only talked about the instance members of the class, those that show up on the object when it's instantiated.\nWe can also create static members of a class, those that are visible on the class itself rather than on the instances.\nIn this example, we use static on the origin, as it's a general value for all grids.\nEach instance accesses this value through prepending the name of the class.\nSimilarly to prepending this. in front of instance accesses, here we prepend Grid. in front of static accesses.\nclass Grid {\n    static origin = {x: 0, y: 0};\n    calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: {x: number; y: number;}) {\n        let xDist = (point.x - Grid.origin.x);\n        let yDist = (point.y - Grid.origin.y);\n        return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;\n    }\n    constructor (public scale: number) { }\n}\n\nlet grid1 = new Grid(1.0);  // 1x scale\nlet grid2 = new Grid(5.0);  // 5x scale\n\nconsole.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\nconsole.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));\n\nAbstract Classes\nAbstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived.\nThey may not be instantiated directly.\nUnlike an interface, an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members.\nThe abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.\nabstract class Animal {\n    abstract makeSound(): void;\n    move(): void {\n        console.log(\"roaming the earth...\");\n    }\n}\n\nMethods within an abstract class that are marked as abstract do not contain an implementation and must be implemented in derived classes.\nAbstract methods share a similar syntax to interface methods.\nBoth define the signature of a method without including a method body.\nHowever, abstract methods must include the abstract keyword and may optionally include access modifiers.\nabstract class Department {\n\n    constructor(public name: string) {\n    }\n\n    printName(): void {\n        console.log(\"Department name: \" + this.name);\n    }\n\n    abstract printMeeting(): void; // must be implemented in derived classes\n}\n\nclass AccountingDepartment extends Department {\n\n    constructor() {\n        super(\"Accounting and Auditing\"); // constructors in derived classes must call super()\n    }\n\n    printMeeting(): void {\n        console.log(\"The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.\");\n    }\n\n    generateReports(): void {\n        console.log(\"Generating accounting reports...\");\n    }\n}\n\nlet department: Department; // ok to create a reference to an abstract type\ndepartment = new Department(); // error: cannot create an instance of an abstract class\ndepartment = new AccountingDepartment(); // ok to create and assign a non-abstract subclass\ndepartment.printName();\ndepartment.printMeeting();\ndepartment.generateReports(); // error: method doesn't exist on declared abstract type\n\nAdvanced Techniques\nConstructor functions\nWhen you declare a class in TypeScript, you are actually creating multiple declarations at the same time.\nThe first is the type of the instance of the class.\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter: Greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\nHere, when we say let greeter: Greeter, we're using Greeter as the type of instances of the class Greeter.\nThis is almost second nature to programmers from other object-oriented languages.\nWe're also creating another value that we call the constructor function.\nThis is the function that is called when we new up instances of the class.\nTo see what this looks like in practice, let's take a look at the JavaScript created by the above example:\nlet Greeter = (function () {\n    function Greeter(message) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    };\n    return Greeter;\n})();\n\nlet greeter;\ngreeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\nconsole.log(greeter.greet());\n\nHere, let Greeter is going to be assigned the constructor function.\nWhen we call new and run this function, we get an instance of the class.\nThe constructor function also contains all of the static members of the class.\nAnother way to think of each class is that there is an instance side and a static side.\nLet's modify the example a bit to show this difference:\nclass Greeter {\n    static standardGreeting = \"Hello, there\";\n    greeting: string;\n    greet() {\n        if (this.greeting) {\n            return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n        }\n        else {\n            return Greeter.standardGreeting;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet greeter1: Greeter;\ngreeter1 = new Greeter();\nconsole.log(greeter1.greet());\n\nlet greeterMaker: typeof Greeter = Greeter;\ngreeterMaker.standardGreeting = \"Hey there!\";\n\nlet greeter2: Greeter = new greeterMaker();\nconsole.log(greeter2.greet());\n\nIn this example, greeter1 works similarly to before.\nWe instantiate the Greeter class, and use this object.\nThis we have seen before.\nNext, we then use the class directly.\nHere we create a new variable called greeterMaker.\nThis variable will hold the class itself, or said another way its constructor function.\nHere we use typeof Greeter, that is \"give me the type of the Greeter class itself\" rather than the instance type.\nOr, more precisely, \"give me the type of the symbol called Greeter,\" which is the type of the constructor function.\nThis type will contain all of the static members of Greeter along with the constructor that creates instances of the Greeter class.\nWe show this by using new on greeterMaker, creating new instances of Greeter and invoking them as before.\nUsing a class as an interface\nAs we said in the previous section, a class declaration creates two things: a type representing instances of the class and a constructor function.\nBecause classes create types, you can use them in the same places you would be able to use interfaces.\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\ninterface Point3d extends Point {\n    z: number;\n}\n\nlet point3d: Point3d = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};\n\n"},"pages/Functions.html":{"url":"pages/Functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nFunctions are the fundamental building block of any applications in JavaScript.\nThey're how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules.\nIn TypeScript, while there are classes, namespaces, and modules, functions still play the key role in describing how to do things.\nTypeScript also adds some new capabilities to the standard JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.\nFunctions\nTo begin, just as in JavaScript, TypeScript functions can be created both as a named function or as an anonymous function.\nThis allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for your application, whether you're building a list of functions in an API or a one-off function to hand off to another function.\nTo quickly recap what these two approaches look like in JavaScript:\n// Named function\nfunction add(x, y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\n// Anonymous function\nlet myAdd = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nJust as in JavaScript, functions can refer to variables outside of the function body.\nWhen they do so, they're said to capture these variables.\nWhile understanding how this works, and the trade-offs when using this technique, are outside of the scope of this article, having a firm understanding how this mechanic is an important piece of working with JavaScript and TypeScript.\nlet z = 100;\n\nfunction addToZ(x, y) {\n    return x + y + z;\n}\n\nFunction Types\nTyping the function\nLet's add types to our simple examples from earlier:\nfunction add(x: number, y: number): number {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\nWe can add types to each of the parameters and then to the function itself to add a return type.\nTypeScript can figure the return type out by looking at the return statements, so we can also optionally leave this off in many cases.\nWriting the function type\nNow that we've typed the function, let's write the full type of the function out by looking at each piece of the function type.\nlet myAdd: (x: number, y: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\nA function's type has the same two parts: the type of the arguments and the return type.\nWhen writing out the whole function type, both parts are required.\nWe write out the parameter types just like a parameter list, giving each parameter a name and a type.\nThis name is just to help with readability.\nWe could have instead written:\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x + y; };\n\nAs long as the parameter types line up, it's considered a valid type for the function, regardless of the names you give the parameters in the function type.\nThe second part is the return type.\nWe make it clear which is the return type by using a fat arrow (=>) between the parameters and the return type.\nAs mentioned before, this is a required part of the function type, so if the function doesn't return a value, you would use void instead of leaving it off.\nOf note, only the parameters and the return type make up the function type.\nCaptured variables are not reflected in the type.\nIn effect, captured variables are part of the \"hidden state\" of any function and do not make up its API.\nInferring the types\nIn playing with the example, you may notice that the TypeScript compiler can figure out the type if you have types on one side of the equation but not the other:\n// myAdd has the full function type\nlet myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return  x + y; };\n\n// The parameters 'x' and 'y' have the type number\nlet myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number =\n    function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nThis is called \"contextual typing\", a form of type inference.\nThis helps cut down on the amount of effort to keep your program typed.\nOptional and Default Parameters\nIn TypeScript, every parameter is assumed to be required by the function.\nThis doesn't mean that it can't be given null or undefined, but rather, when the function is called the compiler will check that the user has provided a value for each parameter.\nThe compiler also assumes that these parameters are the only parameters that will be passed to the function.\nIn short, the number of arguments given to a function has to match the number of parameters the function expects.\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // error, too few parameters\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // error, too many parameters\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // ah, just right\n\nIn JavaScript, every parameter is optional, and users may leave them off as they see fit.\nWhen they do, their value is undefined.\nWe can get this functionality in TypeScript by adding a ? to the end of parameters we want to be optional.\nFor example, let's say we want the last name parameter from above to be optional:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    if (lastName)\n        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n    else\n        return firstName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // works correctly now\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // error, too many parameters\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // ah, just right\n\nAny optional parameters must follow required parameters.\nHad we wanted to make the first name optional rather than the last name, we would need to change the order of parameters in the function, putting the first name last in the list.\nIn TypeScript, we can also set a value that a parameter will be assigned if the user does not provide one, or if the user passes undefined in its place.\nThese are called default-initialized parameters.\nLet's take the previous example and default the last name to \"Smith\".\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // works correctly now, returns \"Bob Smith\"\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", undefined);       // still works, also returns \"Bob Smith\"\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // error, too many parameters\nlet result4 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // ah, just right\n\nDefault-initialized parameters that come after all required parameters are treated as optional, and just like optional parameters, can be omitted when calling their respective function.\nThis means optional parameters and trailing default parameters will share commonality in their types, so both\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nand\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, lastName = \"Smith\") {\n    // ...\n}\n\nshare the same type (firstName: string, lastName?: string) => string.\nThe default value of lastName disappears in the type, only leaving behind the fact that the parameter is optional.\nUnlike plain optional parameters, default-initialized parameters don't need to occur after required parameters.\nIf a default-initialized parameter comes before a required parameter, users need to explicitly pass undefined to get the default initialized value.\nFor example, we could write our last example with only a default initializer on firstName:\nfunction buildName(firstName = \"Will\", lastName: string) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n}\n\nlet result1 = buildName(\"Bob\");                  // error, too few parameters\nlet result2 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\", \"Sr.\");  // error, too many parameters\nlet result3 = buildName(\"Bob\", \"Adams\");         // okay and returns \"Bob Adams\"\nlet result4 = buildName(undefined, \"Adams\");     // okay and returns \"Will Adams\"\n\nRest Parameters\nRequired, optional, and default parameters all have one thing in common: they talk about one parameter at a time.\nSometimes, you want to work with multiple parameters as a group, or you may not know how many parameters a function will ultimately take.\nIn JavaScript, you can work with the arguments directly using the arguments variable that is visible inside every function body.\nIn TypeScript, you can gather these arguments together into a variable:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet employeeName = buildName(\"Joseph\", \"Samuel\", \"Lucas\", \"MacKinzie\");\n\nRest parameters are treated as a boundless number of optional parameters.\nWhen passing arguments for a rest parameter, you can use as many as you want; you can even pass none.\nThe compiler will build an array of the arguments passed in with the name given after the ellipsis (...), allowing you to use it in your function.\nThe ellipsis is also used in the type of the function with rest parameters:\nfunction buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {\n    return firstName + \" \" + restOfName.join(\" \");\n}\n\nlet buildNameFun: (fname: string, ...rest: string[]) => string = buildName;\n\nthis\nLearning how to use this in JavaScript is something of a rite of passage.\nSince TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript developers also need to learn how to use this and how to spot when it's not being used correctly.\nFortunately, TypeScript lets you catch incorrect uses of this with a couple of techniques.\nIf you need to learn how this works in JavaScript, though, first read Yehuda Katz's Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and \"this\".\nYehuda's article explains the inner workings of this very well, so we'll just cover the basics here.\nthis and arrow functions\nIn JavaScript, this is a variable that's set when a function is called.\nThis makes it a very powerful and flexible feature, but it comes at the cost of always having to know about the context that a function is executing in.\nThis is notoriously confusing, especially when returning a function or passing a function as an argument.\nLet's look at an example:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        return function() {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\nNotice that createCardPicker is a function that itself returns a function.\nIf we tried to run the example, we would get an error instead of the expected alert box.\nThis is because the this being used in the function created by createCardPicker will be set to window instead of our deck object.\nThat's because we call cardPicker() on its own.\nA top-level non-method syntax call like this will use window for this.\n(Note: under strict mode, this will be undefined rather than window).\nWe can fix this by making sure the function is bound to the correct this before we return the function to be used later.\nThis way, regardless of how it's later used, it will still be able to see the original deck object.\nTo do this, we change the function expression to use the ECMAScript 6 arrow syntax.\nArrow functions capture the this where the function is created rather than where it is invoked:\nlet deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    createCardPicker: function() {\n        // NOTE: the line below is now an arrow function, allowing us to capture 'this' right here\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\nEven better, TypeScript will warn you when you make this mistake if you pass the --noImplicitThis flag to the compiler.\nIt will point out that this in this.suits[pickedSuit] is of type any.\nthis parameters\nUnfortunately, the type of this.suits[pickedSuit] is still any.\nThat's because this comes from the function expression inside the object literal.\nTo fix this, you can provide an explicit this parameter.\nthis parameters are fake parameters that come first in the parameter list of a function:\nfunction f(this: void) {\n    // make sure `this` is unusable in this standalone function\n}\n\nLet's add a couple of interfaces to our example above, Card and Deck, to make the types clearer and easier to reuse:\ninterface Card {\n    suit: string;\n    card: number;\n}\ninterface Deck {\n    suits: string[];\n    cards: number[];\n    createCardPicker(this: Deck): () => Card;\n}\nlet deck: Deck = {\n    suits: [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"],\n    cards: Array(52),\n    // NOTE: The function now explicitly specifies that its callee must be of type Deck\n    createCardPicker: function(this: Deck) {\n        return () => {\n            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);\n            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);\n\n            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();\nlet pickedCard = cardPicker();\n\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard.card + \" of \" + pickedCard.suit);\n\nNow TypeScript knows that createCardPicker expects to be called on a Deck object.\nThat means that this is of type Deck now, not any, so --noImplicitThis will not cause any errors.\nthis parameters in callbacks\nYou can also run into errors with this in callbacks, when you pass functions to a library that will later call them.\nBecause the library that calls your callback will call it like a normal function, this will be undefined.\nWith some work you can use this parameters to prevent errors with callbacks too.\nFirst, the library author needs to annotate the callback type with this:\ninterface UIElement {\n    addClickListener(onclick: (this: void, e: Event) => void): void;\n}\n\nthis: void means that addClickListener expects onclick to be a function that does not require a this type.\nSecond, annotate your calling code with this:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickBad(this: Handler, e: Event) {\n        // oops, used this here. using this callback would crash at runtime\n        this.info = e.message;\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickBad); // error!\n\nWith this annotated, you make it explicit that onClickBad must be called on an instance of Handler.\nThen TypeScript will detect that addClickListener requires a function that has this: void.\nTo fix the error, change the type of this:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood(this: void, e: Event) {\n        // can't use this here because it's of type void!\n        console.log('clicked!');\n    }\n}\nlet h = new Handler();\nuiElement.addClickListener(h.onClickGood);\n\nBecause onClickGood specifies its this type as void, it is legal to pass to addClickListener.\nOf course, this also means that it can't use this.info.\nIf you want both then you'll have to use an arrow function:\nclass Handler {\n    info: string;\n    onClickGood = (e: Event) => { this.info = e.message }\n}\n\nThis works because arrow functions don't capture this, so you can always pass them to something that expects this: void.\nThe downside is that one arrow function is created per object of type Handler.\nMethods, on the other hand, are only created once and attached to Handler's prototype.\nThey are shared between all objects of type Handler.\nOverloads\nJavaScript is inherently a very dynamic language.\nIt's not uncommon for a single JavaScript function to return different types of objects based on the shape of the arguments passed in.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // Check to see if we're working with an object/array\n    // if so, they gave us the deck and we'll pick the card\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // Otherwise just let them pick the card\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\nHere the pickCard function will return two different things based on what the user has passed in.\nIf the users passes in an object that represents the deck, the function will pick the card.\nIf the user picks the card, we tell them which card they've picked.\nBut how do we describe this to the type system?\nThe answer is to supply multiple function types for the same function as a list of overloads.\nThis list is what the compiler will use to resolve function calls.\nLet's create a list of overloads that describe what our pickCard accepts and what it returns.\nlet suits = [\"hearts\", \"spades\", \"clubs\", \"diamonds\"];\n\nfunction pickCard(x: {suit: string; card: number; }[]): number;\nfunction pickCard(x: number): {suit: string; card: number; };\nfunction pickCard(x): any {\n    // Check to see if we're working with an object/array\n    // if so, they gave us the deck and we'll pick the card\n    if (typeof x == \"object\") {\n        let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * x.length);\n        return pickedCard;\n    }\n    // Otherwise just let them pick the card\n    else if (typeof x == \"number\") {\n        let pickedSuit = Math.floor(x / 13);\n        return { suit: suits[pickedSuit], card: x % 13 };\n    }\n}\n\nlet myDeck = [{ suit: \"diamonds\", card: 2 }, { suit: \"spades\", card: 10 }, { suit: \"hearts\", card: 4 }];\nlet pickedCard1 = myDeck[pickCard(myDeck)];\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard1.card + \" of \" + pickedCard1.suit);\n\nlet pickedCard2 = pickCard(15);\nalert(\"card: \" + pickedCard2.card + \" of \" + pickedCard2.suit);\n\nWith this change, the overloads now give us type-checked calls to the pickCard function.\nIn order for the compiler to pick the correct typecheck, it follows a similar process to the underlying JavaScript.\nIt looks at the overload list, and proceeding with the first overload attempts to call the function with the provided parameters.\nIf it finds a match, it picks this overload as the correct overload.\nFor this reason, it's customary to order overloads from most specific to least specific.\nNote that the function pickCard(x): any piece is not part of the overload list, so it only has two overloads: one that takes an object and one that takes a number.\nCalling pickCard with any other parameter types would cause an error.\n"},"pages/Generics.html":{"url":"pages/Generics.html","title":"Generics","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nA major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable.\nComponents that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.\nIn languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is generics, that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.\nThis allows users to consume these components and use their own types.\nHello World of Generics\nTo start off, let's do the \"hello world\" of generics: the identity function.\nThe identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in.\nYou can think of this in a similar way to the echo command.\nWithout generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:\nfunction identity(arg: number): number {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nOr, we could describe the identity function using the any type:\nfunction identity(arg: any): any {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nWhile using any is certainly generic in that it will cause the function to accept any and all types for the type of arg, we actually are losing the information about what that type was when the function returns.\nIf we passed in a number, the only information we have is that any type could be returned.\nInstead, we need a way of capturing the type of the argument in such a way that we can also use it to denote what is being returned.\nHere, we will use a type variable, a special kind of variable that works on types rather than values.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nWe've now added a type variable T to the identity function.\nThis T allows us to capture the type the user provides (e.g. number), so that we can use that information later.\nHere, we use T again as the return type. On inspection, we can now see the same type is used for the argument and the return type.\nThis allows us to traffic that type information in one side of the function and out the other.\nWe say that this version of the identity function is generic, as it works over a range of types.\nUnlike using any, it's also just as precise (ie, it doesn't lose any information) as the first identity function that used numbers for the argument and return type.\nOnce we've written the generic identity function, we can call it in one of two ways.\nThe first way is to pass all of the arguments, including the type argument, to the function:\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // type of output will be 'string'\n\nHere we explicitly set T to be string as one of the arguments to the function call, denoted using the <> around the arguments rather than ().\nThe second way is also perhaps the most common. Here we use type argument inference -- that is, we want the compiler to set the value of T for us automatically based on the type of the argument we pass in:\nlet output = identity(\"myString\");  // type of output will be 'string'\n\nNotice that we didn't have to explicitly pass the type in the angle brackets (<>); the compiler just looked at the value \"myString\", and set T to its type.\nWhile type argument inference can be a helpful tool to keep code shorter and more readable, you may need to explicitly pass in the type arguments as we did in the previous example when the compiler fails to infer the type, as may happen in more complex examples.\nWorking with Generic Type Variables\nWhen you begin to use generics, you'll notice that when you create generic functions like identity, the compiler will enforce that you use any generically typed parameters in the body of the function correctly.\nThat is, that you actually treat these parameters as if they could be any and all types.\nLet's take our identity function from earlier:\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nWhat if we want to also log the length of the argument arg to the console with each call?\nWe might be tempted to write this:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Error: T doesn't have .length\n    return arg;\n}\n\nWhen we do, the compiler will give us an error that we're using the .length member of arg, but nowhere have we said that arg has this member.\nRemember, we said earlier that these type variables stand in for any and all types, so someone using this function could have passed in a number instead, which does not have a .length member.\nLet's say that we've actually intended this function to work on arrays of T rather than T directly. Since we're working with arrays, the .length member should be available.\nWe can describe this just like we would create arrays of other types:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T[]): T[] {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array has a .length, so no more error\n    return arg;\n}\n\nYou can read the type of loggingIdentity as \"the generic function loggingIdentity takes a type parameter T, and an argument arg which is an array of Ts, and returns an array of Ts.\"\nIf we passed in an array of numbers, we'd get an array of numbers back out, as T would bind to number.\nThis allows us to use our generic type variable T as part of the types we're working with, rather than the whole type, giving us greater flexibility.\nWe can alternatively write the sample example this way:\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: Array): Array {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Array has a .length, so no more error\n    return arg;\n}\n\nYou may already be familiar with this style of type from other languages.\nIn the next section, we'll cover how you can create your own generic types like Array.\nGeneric Types\nIn previous sections, we created generic identity functions that worked over a range of types.\nIn this section, we'll explore the type of the functions themselves and how to create generic interfaces.\nThe type of generic functions is just like those of non-generic functions, with the type parameters listed first, similarly to function declarations:\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: T) => T = identity;\n\nWe could also have used a different name for the generic type parameter in the type, so long as the number of type variables and how the type variables are used line up.\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: (arg: U) => U = identity;\n\nWe can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type:\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: {(arg: T): T} = identity;\n\nWhich leads us to writing our first generic interface.\nLet's take the object literal from the previous example and move it to an interface:\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\nIn a similar example, we may want to move the generic parameter to be a parameter of the whole interface.\nThis lets us see what type(s) we're generic over (e.g. Dictionary rather than just Dictionary).\nThis makes the type parameter visible to all the other members of the interface.\ninterface GenericIdentityFn {\n    (arg: T): T;\n}\n\nfunction identity(arg: T): T {\n    return arg;\n}\n\nlet myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;\n\nNotice that our example has changed to be something slightly different.\nInstead of describing a generic function, we now have a non-generic function signature that is a part of a generic type.\nWhen we use GenericIdentityFn, we now will also need to specify the corresponding type argument (here: number), effectively locking in what the underlying call signature will use.\nUnderstanding when to put the type parameter directly on the call signature and when to put it on the interface itself will be helpful in describing what aspects of a type are generic.\nIn addition to generic interfaces, we can also create generic classes.\nNote that it is not possible to create generic enums and namespaces.\nGeneric Classes\nA generic class has a similar shape to a generic interface.\nGeneric classes have a generic type parameter list in angle brackets (<>) following the name of the class.\nclass GenericNumber {\n    zeroValue: T;\n    add: (x: T, y: T) => T;\n}\n\nlet myGenericNumber = new GenericNumber();\nmyGenericNumber.zeroValue = 0;\nmyGenericNumber.add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nThis is a pretty literal use of the GenericNumber class, but you may have noticed that nothing is restricting it to only use the number type.\nWe could have instead used string or even more complex objects.\nlet stringNumeric = new GenericNumber();\nstringNumeric.zeroValue = \"\";\nstringNumeric.add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };\n\nconsole.log(stringNumeric.add(stringNumeric.zeroValue, \"test\"));\n\nJust as with interface, putting the type parameter on the class itself lets us make sure all of the properties of the class are working with the same type.\nAs we covered in our section on classes, a class has two sides to its type: the static side and the instance side.\nGeneric classes are only generic over their instance side rather than their static side, so when working with classes, static members can not use the class's type parameter.\nGeneric Constraints\nIf you remember from an earlier example, you may sometimes want to write a generic function that works on a set of types where you have some knowledge about what capabilities that set of types will have.\nIn our loggingIdentity example, we wanted to be able to access the .length property of arg, but the compiler could not prove that every type had a .length property, so it warns us that we can't make this assumption.\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Error: T doesn't have .length\n    return arg;\n}\n\nInstead of working with any and all types, we'd like to constrain this function to work with any and all types that also have the .length property.\nAs long as the type has this member, we'll allow it, but it's required to have at least this member.\nTo do so, we must list our requirement as a constraint on what T can be.\nTo do so, we'll create an interface that describes our constraint.\nHere, we'll create an interface that has a single .length property and then we'll use this interface and the extends keyword to denote our constraint:\ninterface Lengthwise {\n    length: number;\n}\n\nfunction loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {\n    console.log(arg.length);  // Now we know it has a .length property, so no more error\n    return arg;\n}\n\nBecause the generic function is now constrained, it will no longer work over any and all types:\nloggingIdentity(3);  // Error, number doesn't have a .length property\n\nInstead, we need to pass in values whose type has all the required properties:\nloggingIdentity({length: 10, value: 3});\n\nUsing Type Parameters in Generic Constraints\nYou can declare a type parameter that is constrained by another type parameter.\nFor example, here we'd like to get a property from an object given its name.\nWe'd like to ensure that we're not accidentally grabbing a property that does not exist on the obj, so we'll place a constraint between the two types:\nfunction getProperty(obj: T, key: K) {\n    return obj[key];\n}\n\nlet x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };\n\ngetProperty(x, \"a\"); // okay\ngetProperty(x, \"m\"); // error: Argument of type 'm' isn't assignable to 'a' | 'b' | 'c' | 'd'.\n\nUsing Class Types in Generics\nWhen creating factories in TypeScript using generics, it is necessary to refer to class types by their constructor functions. For example,\nfunction create(c: {new(): T; }): T {\n    return new c();\n}\n\nA more advanced example uses the prototype property to infer and constrain relationships between the constructor function and the instance side of class types.\nclass BeeKeeper {\n    hasMask: boolean;\n}\n\nclass ZooKeeper {\n    nametag: string;\n}\n\nclass Animal {\n    numLegs: number;\n}\n\nclass Bee extends Animal {\n    keeper: BeeKeeper;\n}\n\nclass Lion extends Animal {\n    keeper: ZooKeeper;\n}\n\nfunction createInstance(c: new () => A): A {\n    return new c();\n}\n\ncreateInstance(Lion).keeper.nametag;  // typechecks!\ncreateInstance(Bee).keeper.hasMask;   // typechecks!\n\n"},"pages/Enums.html":{"url":"pages/Enums.html","title":"Enums","keywords":"","body":"Enums\nEnums allow us to define a set of named constants.\nUsing enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases.\nTypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.\nNumeric enums\nWe'll first start off with numeric enums, which are probably more familiar if you're coming from other languages.\nAn enum can be defined using the enum keyword.\nenum Direction {\n    Up = 1,\n    Down,\n    Left,\n    Right,\n}\n\nAbove, we have a numeric enum where Up is initialized with 1.\nAll of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on.\nIn other words, Direction.Up has the value 1,  Down has 2, Left has 3, and Right has 4.\nIf we wanted, we could leave off the initializers entirely:\nenum Direction {\n    Up,\n    Down,\n    Left,\n    Right,\n}\n\nHere, Up would have the value 0, Down would have 1, etc.\nThis auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, but do care that each value is distinct from other values in the same enum.\nUsing an enum is simple: just access any member as a property off of the enum itself, and declare types using the name of the enum:\nenum Response {\n    No = 0,\n    Yes = 1,\n}\n\nfunction respond(recipient: string, message: Response): void {\n    // ...\n}\n\nrespond(\"Princess Caroline\", Response.Yes)\n\nNumeric enums can be mixed in computed and constant members (see below).\nThe short story is, enums without initializers either need to be first, or have to come after numeric enums initialized with numeric constants or other constant enum members.\nIn other words, the following isn't allowed:\nenum E {\n    A = getSomeValue(),\n    B, // error! 'A' is not constant-initialized, so 'B' needs an initializer\n}\n\nString enums\nString enums are a similar concept, but have some subtle runtime differences as documented below.\nIn a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.\nenum Direction {\n    Up = \"UP\",\n    Down = \"DOWN\",\n    Left = \"LEFT\",\n    Right = \"RIGHT\",\n}\n\nWhile string enums don't have auto-incrementing behavior, string enums have the benefit that they \"serialize\" well.\nIn other words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value is often opaque - it doesn't convey any useful meaning on its own (though reverse mapping can often help), string enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable value when your code runs, independent of the name of the enum member itself.\nHeterogeneous enums\nTechnically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but it's not clear why you would ever want to do so:\nenum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {\n    No = 0,\n    Yes = \"YES\",\n}\n\nUnless you're really trying to take advantage of JavaScript's runtime behavior in a clever way, it's advised that you don't do this.\nComputed and constant members\nEach enum member has a value associated with it which can be either constant or computed.\nAn enum member is considered constant if:\n\nIt is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer, in which case it's assigned the value 0:\n// E.X is constant:\nenum E { X }\n\n\nIt does not have an initializer and the preceding enum member was a numeric constant.\nIn this case the value of the current enum member will be the value of the preceding enum member plus one.\n// All enum members in 'E1' and 'E2' are constant.\n\nenum E1 { X, Y, Z }\n\nenum E2 {\n    A = 1, B, C\n}\n\n\nThe enum member is initialized with a constant enum expression.\nA constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time.\nAn expression is a constant enum expression if it is:\n\na literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)\na reference to previously defined constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum).\na parenthesized constant enum expression\none of the +, -, ~ unary operators applied to constant enum expression\n+, -, *, /, %, , >>, >>>, &, |, ^ binary operators with constant enum expressions as  operands\nIt is a compile time error for constant enum expressions to be evaluated to NaN or Infinity.\n\n\n\nIn all other cases enum member is considered computed.\nenum FileAccess {\n    // constant members\n    None,\n    Read    = 1 \nUnion enums and enum member types\nThere is a special subset of constant enum members that aren't calculated: literal enum members.\nA literal enum member is a constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to\n\nany string literal (e.g. \"foo\", \"bar, \"baz\")\nany numeric literal (e.g. 1, 100)\na unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. -1, -100)\n\nWhen all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come to play.\nThe first is that enum members also become types as well!\nFor example, we can say that certain members can only have the value of an enum member:\nenum ShapeKind {\n    Circle,\n    Square,\n}\n\ninterface Circle {\n    kind: ShapeKind.Circle;\n    radius: number;\n}\n\ninterface Square {\n    kind: ShapeKind.Square;\n    sideLength: number;\n}\n\nlet c: Circle = {\n    kind: ShapeKind.Square,\n    //    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Error!\n    radius: 100,\n}\n\nThe other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a union of each enum member.\nWhile we haven't discussed union types yet, all that you need to know is that with union enums, the type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself.\nBecause of that, TypeScript can catch silly bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly.\nFor example:\nenum E {\n    Foo,\n    Bar,\n}\n\nfunction f(x: E) {\n    if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {\n        //             ~~~~~~~~~~~\n        // Error! Operator '!==' cannot be applied to types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar'.\n    }\n}\n\nIn that example, we first checked whether x was not E.Foo.\nIf that check succeeds, then our || will short-circuit, and the body of the 'if' will get run.\nHowever, if the check didn't succeed, then x can only be E.Foo, so it doesn't make sense to see whether it's equal to E.Bar.\nEnums at runtime\nEnums are real objects that exist at runtime.\nFor example, the following enum\nenum E {\n    X, Y, Z\n}\n\ncan actually be passed around to functions\nfunction f(obj: { X: number }) {\n    return obj.X;\n}\n\n// Works, since 'E' has a property named 'X' which is a number.\nf(E);\n\nReverse mappings\nIn addition to creating an object with property names for members, numeric enums members also get a reverse mapping from enum values to enum names.\nFor example, in this example:\nenum Enum {\n    A\n}\nlet a = Enum.A;\nlet nameOfA = Enum[a]; // \"A\"\n\nTypeScript might compile this down to something like the the following JavaScript:\nvar Enum;\n(function (Enum) {\n    Enum[Enum[\"A\"] = 0] = \"A\";\n})(Enum || (Enum = {}));\nvar a = Enum.A;\nvar nameOfA = Enum[a]; // \"A\"\n\nIn this generated code, an enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward (name -> value) and reverse (value -> name) mappings.\nReferences to other enum members are always emitted as property accesses and never inlined.\nKeep in mind that string enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.\nconst enums\nIn most cases, enums are a perfectly valid solution.\nHowever sometimes requirements are tighter.\nTo avoid paying the cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, it's possible to use const enums.\nConst enums are defined using the const modifier on our enums:\nconst enum Enum {\n    A = 1,\n    B = A * 2\n}\n\nConst enums can only use constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during compilation.\nConst enum members are inlined at use sites.\nThis is possible since const enums cannot have computed members.\nconst enum Directions {\n    Up,\n    Down,\n    Left,\n    Right\n}\n\nlet directions = [Directions.Up, Directions.Down, Directions.Left, Directions.Right]\n\nin generated code will become\nvar directions = [0 /* Up */, 1 /* Down */, 2 /* Left */, 3 /* Right */];\n\nAmbient enums\nAmbient enums are used to describe the shape of already existing enum types.\ndeclare enum Enum {\n    A = 1,\n    B,\n    C = 2\n}\n\nOne important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that don't have an initializer will be considered constant if its preceding enum member is considered constant.\nIn contrast, an ambient (and non-const) enum member that does not have initializer is always considered computed.\n"},"pages/Type Inference.html":{"url":"pages/Type Inference.html","title":"Type Inference","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nIn this section, we will cover type inference in TypeScript. Namely, we'll discuss where and how types are inferred.\nBasics\nIn TypeScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. For example, in this code\nlet x = 3;\n\nThe type of the x variable is inferred to be number.\nThis kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.\nIn most cases, type inference is straightforward.\nIn the following sections, we'll explore some of the nuances in how types are inferred.\nBest common type\nWhen a type inference is made from several expressions, the types of those expressions are used to calculate a \"best common type\". For example,\nlet x = [0, 1, null];\n\nTo infer the type of x in the example above, we must consider the type of each array element.\nHere we are given two choices for the type of the array: number and null.\nThe best common type algorithm considers each candidate type, and picks the type that is compatible with all the other candidates.\nBecause the best common type has to be chosen from the provided candidate types, there are some cases where types share a common structure, but no one type is the super type of all candidate types. For example:\nlet zoo = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];\n\nIdeally, we may want zoo to be inferred as an Animal[], but because there is no object that is strictly of type Animal in the array, we make no inference about the array element type.\nTo correct this, instead explicitly provide the type when no one type is a super type of all other candidates:\nlet zoo: Animal[] = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];\n\nWhen no best common type is found, the resulting inference is the union array type, (Rhino | Elephant | Snake)[].\nContextual Type\nType inference also works in \"the other direction\" in some cases in TypeScript.\nThis is known as \"contextual typing\". Contextual typing occurs when the type of an expression is implied by its location. For example:\nwindow.onmousedown = function(mouseEvent) {\n    console.log(mouseEvent.button);  //\nFor the code above to give the type error, the TypeScript type checker used the type of the Window.onmousedown function to infer the type of the function expression on the right hand side of the assignment.\nWhen it did so, it was able to infer the type of the mouseEvent parameter.\nIf this function expression were not in a contextually typed position, the mouseEvent parameter would have type any, and no error would have been issued.\nIf the contextually typed expression contains explicit type information, the contextual type is ignored.\nHad we written the above example:\nwindow.onmousedown = function(mouseEvent: any) {\n    console.log(mouseEvent.button);  //\nThe function expression with an explicit type annotation on the parameter will override the contextual type.\nOnce it does so, no error is given as no contextual type applies.\nContextual typing applies in many cases.\nCommon cases include arguments to function calls, right hand sides of assignments, type assertions, members of object and array literals, and return statements.\nThe contextual type also acts as a candidate type in best common type. For example:\nfunction createZoo(): Animal[] {\n    return [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];\n}\n\nIn this example, best common type has a set of four candidates: Animal, Rhino, Elephant, and Snake.\nOf these, Animal can be chosen by the best common type algorithm.\n"},"pages/Type Compatibility.html":{"url":"pages/Type Compatibility.html","title":"Type Compatibility","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nType compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping.\nStructural typing is a way of relating types based solely on their members.\nThis is in contrast with nominal typing.\nConsider the following code:\ninterface Named {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nclass Person {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nlet p: Named;\n// OK, because of structural typing\np = new Person();\n\nIn nominally-typed languages like C# or Java, the equivalent code would be an error because the Person class does not explicitly describe itself as being an implementer of the Named interface.\nTypeScript's structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript code is typically written.\nBecause JavaScript widely uses anonymous objects like function expressions and object literals, it's much more natural to represent the kinds of relationships found in JavaScript libraries with a structural type system instead of a nominal one.\nA Note on Soundness\nTypeScript's type system allows certain operations that can't be known at compile-time to be safe. When a type system has this property, it is said to not be \"sound\". The places where TypeScript allows unsound behavior were carefully considered, and throughout this document we'll explain where these happen and the motivating scenarios behind them.\nStarting out\nThe basic rule for TypeScript's structural type system is that x is compatible with y if y has at least the same members as x. For example:\ninterface Named {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nlet x: Named;\n// y's inferred type is { name: string; location: string; }\nlet y = { name: \"Alice\", location: \"Seattle\" };\nx = y;\n\nTo check whether y can be assigned to x, the compiler checks each property of x to find a corresponding compatible property in y.\nIn this case, y must have a member called name that is a string. It does, so the assignment is allowed.\nThe same rule for assignment is used when checking function call arguments:\nfunction greet(n: Named) {\n    console.log(\"Hello, \" + n.name);\n}\ngreet(y); // OK\n\nNote that y has an extra location property, but this does not create an error.\nOnly members of the target type (Named in this case) are considered when checking for compatibility.\nThis comparison process proceeds recursively, exploring the type of each member and sub-member.\nComparing two functions\nWhile comparing primitive types and object types is relatively straightforward, the question of what kinds of functions should be considered compatible is a bit more involved.\nLet's start with a basic example of two functions that differ only in their parameter lists:\nlet x = (a: number) => 0;\nlet y = (b: number, s: string) => 0;\n\ny = x; // OK\nx = y; // Error\n\nTo check if x is assignable to y, we first look at the parameter list.\nEach parameter in x must have a corresponding parameter in y with a compatible type.\nNote that the names of the parameters are not considered, only their types.\nIn this case, every parameter of x has a corresponding compatible parameter in y, so the assignment is allowed.\nThe second assignment is an error, because y has a required second parameter that x does not have, so the assignment is disallowed.\nYou may be wondering why we allow 'discarding' parameters like in the example y = x.\nThe reason for this assignment to be allowed is that ignoring extra function parameters is actually quite common in JavaScript.\nFor example, Array#forEach provides three parameters to the callback function: the array element, its index, and the containing array.\nNevertheless, it's very useful to provide a callback that only uses the first parameter:\nlet items = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// Don't force these extra parameters\nitems.forEach((item, index, array) => console.log(item));\n\n// Should be OK!\nitems.forEach(item => console.log(item));\n\nNow let's look at how return types are treated, using two functions that differ only by their return type:\nlet x = () => ({name: \"Alice\"});\nlet y = () => ({name: \"Alice\", location: \"Seattle\"});\n\nx = y; // OK\ny = x; // Error, because x() lacks a location property\n\nThe type system enforces that the source function's return type be a subtype of the target type's return type.\nFunction Parameter Bivariance\nWhen comparing the types of function parameters, assignment succeeds if either the source parameter is assignable to the target parameter, or vice versa.\nThis is unsound because a caller might end up being given a function that takes a more specialized type, but invokes the function with a less specialized type.\nIn practice, this sort of error is rare, and allowing this enables many common JavaScript patterns. A brief example:\nenum EventType { Mouse, Keyboard }\n\ninterface Event { timestamp: number; }\ninterface MouseEvent extends Event { x: number; y: number }\ninterface KeyEvent extends Event { keyCode: number }\n\nfunction listenEvent(eventType: EventType, handler: (n: Event) => void) {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n// Unsound, but useful and common\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: MouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + \",\" + e.y));\n\n// Undesirable alternatives in presence of soundness\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: Event) => console.log((e).x + \",\" + (e).y));\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse,  void>((e: MouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + \",\" + e.y)));\n\n// Still disallowed (clear error). Type safety enforced for wholly incompatible types\nlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: number) => console.log(e));\n\nOptional Parameters and Rest Parameters\nWhen comparing functions for compatibility, optional and required parameters are interchangeable.\nExtra optional parameters of the source type are not an error, and optional parameters of the target type without corresponding parameters in the source type are not an error.\nWhen a function has a rest parameter, it is treated as if it were an infinite series of optional parameters.\nThis is unsound from a type system perspective, but from a runtime point of view the idea of an optional parameter is generally not well-enforced since passing undefined in that position is equivalent for most functions.\nThe motivating example is the common pattern of a function that takes a callback and invokes it with some predictable (to the programmer) but unknown (to the type system) number of arguments:\nfunction invokeLater(args: any[], callback: (...args: any[]) => void) {\n    /* ... Invoke callback with 'args' ... */\n}\n\n// Unsound - invokeLater \"might\" provide any number of arguments\ninvokeLater([1, 2], (x, y) => console.log(x + \", \" + y));\n\n// Confusing (x and y are actually required) and undiscoverable\ninvokeLater([1, 2], (x?, y?) => console.log(x + \", \" + y));\n\nFunctions with overloads\nWhen a function has overloads, each overload in the source type must be matched by a compatible signature on the target type.\nThis ensures that the target function can be called in all the same situations as the source function.\nEnums\nEnums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,\nenum Status { Ready, Waiting };\nenum Color { Red, Blue, Green };\n\nlet status = Status.Ready;\nstatus = Color.Green;  // Error\n\nClasses\nClasses work similarly to object literal types and interfaces with one exception: they have both a static and an instance type.\nWhen comparing two objects of a class type, only members of the instance are compared.\nStatic members and constructors do not affect compatibility.\nclass Animal {\n    feet: number;\n    constructor(name: string, numFeet: number) { }\n}\n\nclass Size {\n    feet: number;\n    constructor(numFeet: number) { }\n}\n\nlet a: Animal;\nlet s: Size;\n\na = s;  // OK\ns = a;  // OK\n\nPrivate and protected members in classes\nPrivate and protected members in a class affect their compatibility.\nWhen an instance of a class is checked for compatibility, if the target type contains a private member, then the source type must also contain a private member that originated from the same class.\nLikewise, the same applies for an instance with a protected member.\nThis allows a class to be assignment compatible with its super class, but not with classes from a different inheritance hierarchy which otherwise have the same shape.\nGenerics\nBecause TypeScript is a structural type system, type parameters only affect the resulting type when consumed as part of the type of a member. For example,\ninterface Empty {\n}\nlet x: Empty;\nlet y: Empty;\n\nx = y;  // OK, because y matches structure of x\n\nIn the above, x and y are compatible because their structures do not use the type argument in a differentiating way.\nChanging this example by adding a member to Empty shows how this works:\ninterface NotEmpty {\n    data: T;\n}\nlet x: NotEmpty;\nlet y: NotEmpty;\n\nx = y;  // Error, because x and y are not compatible\n\nIn this way, a generic type that has its type arguments specified acts just like a non-generic type.\nFor generic types that do not have their type arguments specified, compatibility is checked by specifying any in place of all unspecified type arguments.\nThe resulting types are then checked for compatibility, just as in the non-generic case.\nFor example,\nlet identity = function(x: T): T {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet reverse = function(y: U): U {\n    // ...\n}\n\nidentity = reverse;  // OK, because (x: any) => any matches (y: any) => any\n\nAdvanced Topics\nSubtype vs Assignment\nSo far, we've used \"compatible\", which is not a term defined in the language spec.\nIn TypeScript, there are two kinds of compatibility: subtype and assignment.\nThese differ only in that assignment extends subtype compatibility with rules to allow assignment to and from any, and to and from enum with corresponding numeric values.\nDifferent places in the language use one of the two compatibility mechanisms, depending on the situation.\nFor practical purposes, type compatibility is dictated by assignment compatibility, even in the cases of the implements and extends clauses.\nFor more information, see the TypeScript spec.\n"},"pages/Advanced Types.html":{"url":"pages/Advanced Types.html","title":"Advanced Types","keywords":"","body":"Intersection Types\nAn intersection type combines multiple types into one.\nThis allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.\nFor example, Person & Serializable & Loggable is a Person and Serializable and Loggable.\nThat means an object of this type will have all members of all three types.\nYou will mostly see intersection types used for mixins and other concepts that don't fit in the classic object-oriented mold.\n(There are a lot of these in JavaScript!)\nHere's a simple example that shows how to create a

jim.name;\njim.log();\n\nUnion Types\nUnion types are closely related to intersection types, but they are used very differently.\nOccasionally, you'll run into a library that expects a parameter to be either a number or a string.\nFor instance, take the following function:\n/**\n * Takes a string and adds \"padding\" to the left.\n * If 'padding' is a string, then 'padding' is appended to the left side.\n * If 'padding' is a number, then that number of spaces is added to the left side.\n */\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: any) {\n    if (typeof padding === \"number\") {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (typeof padding === \"string\") {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\npadLeft(\"Hello world\", 4); // returns \"    Hello world\"\n\nThe problem with padLeft is that its padding parameter is typed as any.\nThat means that we can call it with an argument that's neither a number nor a string, but TypeScript will be okay with it.\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // passes at compile time, fails at runtime.\n\nIn traditional object-oriented code, we might abstract over the two types by creating a hierarchy of types.\nWhile this is much more explicit, it's also a little bit overkill.\nOne of the nice things about the original version of padLeft was that we were able to just pass in primitives.\nThat meant that usage was simple and concise.\nThis new approach also wouldn't help if we were just trying to use a function that already exists elsewhere.\nInstead of any, we can use a union type for the padding parameter:\n/**\n * Takes a string and adds \"padding\" to the left.\n * If 'padding' is a string, then 'padding' is appended to the left side.\n * If 'padding' is a number, then that number of spaces is added to the left side.\n */\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet indentedString = padLeft(\"Hello world\", true); // errors during compilation\n\nA union type describes a value that can be one of several types.\nWe use the vertical bar (|) to separate each type, so number | string | boolean is the type of a value that can be a number, a string, or a boolean.\nIf we have a value that has a union type, we can only access members that are common to all types in the union.\ninterface Bird {\n    fly();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\ninterface Fish {\n    swim();\n    layEggs();\n}\n\nfunction getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\npet.layEggs(); // okay\npet.swim();    // errors\n\nUnion types can be a bit tricky here, but it just takes a bit of intuition to get used to.\nIf a value has the type A | B, we only know for certain that it has members that both A and B have.\nIn this example, Bird has a member named fly.\nWe can't be sure whether a variable typed as Bird | Fish has a fly method.\nIf the variable is really a Fish at runtime, then calling pet.fly() will fail.\nType Guards and Differentiating Types\nUnion types are useful for modeling situations when values can overlap in the types they can take on.\nWhat happens when we need to know specifically whether we have a Fish?\nA common idiom in JavaScript to differentiate between two possible values is to check for the presence of a member.\nAs we mentioned, you can only access members that are guaranteed to be in all the constituents of a union type.\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\n// Each of these property accesses will cause an error\nif (pet.swim) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse if (pet.fly) {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\nTo get the same code working, we'll need to use a type assertion:\nlet pet = getSmallPet();\n\nif ((pet).swim) {\n    (pet).swim();\n}\nelse {\n    (pet).fly();\n}\n\nUser-Defined Type Guards\nNotice that we had to use type assertions several times.\nIt would be much better if once we performed the check, we could know the type of pet within each branch.\nIt just so happens that TypeScript has something called a type guard.\nA type guard is some expression that performs a runtime check that guarantees the type in some scope.\nTo define a type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a type predicate:\nfunction isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {\n    return (pet).swim !== undefined;\n}\n\npet is Fish is our type predicate in this example.\nA predicate takes the form parameterName is Type, where parameterName must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.\nAny time isFish is called with some variable, TypeScript will narrow that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.\n// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.\n\nif (isFish(pet)) {\n    pet.swim();\n}\nelse {\n    pet.fly();\n}\n\nNotice that TypeScript not only knows that pet is a Fish in the if branch;\nit also knows that in the else branch, you don't have a Fish, so you must have a Bird.\ntypeof type guards\nLet's go back and write the code for the version of padLeft that uses union types.\nWe could write it with type predicates as follows:\nfunction isNumber(x: any): x is number {\n    return typeof x === \"number\";\n}\n\nfunction isString(x: any): x is string {\n    return typeof x === \"string\";\n}\n\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (isNumber(padding)) {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (isString(padding)) {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\nHowever, having to define a function to figure out if a type is a primitive is kind of a pain.\nLuckily, you don't need to abstract typeof x === \"number\" into its own function because TypeScript will recognize it as a type guard on its own.\nThat means we could just write these checks inline.\nfunction padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {\n    if (typeof padding === \"number\") {\n        return Array(padding + 1).join(\" \") + value;\n    }\n    if (typeof padding === \"string\") {\n        return padding + value;\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`);\n}\n\nThese typeof type guards are recognized in two different forms: typeof v === \"typename\" and typeof v !== \"typename\", where \"typename\" must be \"number\", \"string\", \"boolean\", or \"symbol\".\nWhile TypeScript won't stop you from comparing to other strings, the language won't recognize those expressions as type guards.\ninstanceof type guards\nIf you've read about typeof type guards and are familiar with the instanceof operator in JavaScript, you probably have some idea of what this section is about.\ninstanceof type guards are a way of narrowing types using their constructor function.\nFor instance, let's borrow our industrial string-padder example from earlier:\ninterface Padder {\n    getPaddingString(): string\n}\n\nclass SpaceRepeatingPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private numSpaces: number) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return Array(this.numSpaces + 1).join(\" \");\n    }\n}\n\nclass StringPadder implements Padder {\n    constructor(private value: string) { }\n    getPaddingString() {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction getRandomPadder() {\n    return Math.random() \nThe right side of the instanceof needs to be a constructor function, and TypeScript will narrow down to:\n\nthe type of the function's prototype property if its type is not any\nthe union of types returned by that type's construct signatures\n\nin that order.\nNullable types\nTypeScript has two special types, null and undefined, that have the values null and undefined respectively.\nWe mentioned these briefly in the Basic Types section.\nBy default, the type checker considers null and undefined assignable to anything.\nEffectively, null and undefined are valid values of every type.\nThat means it's not possible to stop them from being assigned to any type, even when you would like to prevent it.\nThe inventor of null, Tony Hoare, calls this his \"billion dollar mistake\".\nThe --strictNullChecks flag fixes this: when you declare a variable, it doesn't automatically include null or undefined.\nYou can include them explicitly using a union type:\nlet s = \"foo\";\ns = null; // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'string'\nlet sn: string | null = \"bar\";\nsn = null; // ok\n\nsn = undefined; // error, 'undefined' is not assignable to 'string | null'\n\nNote that TypeScript treats null and undefined differently in order to match JavaScript semantics.\nstring | null is a different type than string | undefined and string | undefined | null.\nOptional parameters and properties\nWith --strictNullChecks, an optional parameter automatically adds | undefined:\nfunction f(x: number, y?: number) {\n    return x + (y || 0);\n}\nf(1, 2);\nf(1);\nf(1, undefined);\nf(1, null); // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'number | undefined'\n\nThe same is true for optional properties:\nclass C {\n    a: number;\n    b?: number;\n}\nlet c = new C();\nc.a = 12;\nc.a = undefined; // error, 'undefined' is not assignable to 'number'\nc.b = 13;\nc.b = undefined; // ok\nc.b = null; // error, 'null' is not assignable to 'number | undefined'\n\nType guards and type assertions\nSince nullable types are implemented with a union, you need to use a type guard to get rid of the null.\nFortunately, this is the same code you'd write in JavaScript:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    if (sn == null) {\n        return \"default\";\n    }\n    else {\n        return sn;\n    }\n}\n\nThe null elimination is pretty obvious here, but you can use terser operators too:\nfunction f(sn: string | null): string {\n    return sn || \"default\";\n}\n\nIn cases where the compiler can't eliminate null or undefined, you can use the type assertion operator to manually remove them.\nThe syntax is postfix !: identifier! removes null and undefined from the type of identifier:\nfunction broken(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // error, 'name' is possibly null\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\nfunction fixed(name: string | null): string {\n  function postfix(epithet: string) {\n    return name!.charAt(0) + '.  the ' + epithet; // ok\n  }\n  name = name || \"Bob\";\n  return postfix(\"great\");\n}\n\nThe example uses a nested function here because the compiler can't eliminate nulls inside a nested function (except immediately-invoked function expressions).\nThat's because it can't track all calls to the nested function, especially if you return it from the outer function.\nWithout knowing where the function is called, it can't know what the type of name will be at the time the body executes.\nType Aliases\nType aliases create a new name for a type.\nType aliases are sometimes similar to interfaces, but can name primitives, unions, tuples, and any other types that you'd otherwise have to write by hand.\ntype Name = string;\ntype NameResolver = () => string;\ntype NameOrResolver = Name | NameResolver;\nfunction getName(n: NameOrResolver): Name {\n    if (typeof n === \"string\") {\n        return n;\n    }\n    else {\n        return n();\n    }\n}\n\nAliasing doesn't actually create a new type - it creates a new name to refer to that type.\nAliasing a primitive is not terribly useful, though it can be used as a form of documentation.\nJust like interfaces, type aliases can also be generic - we can just add type parameters and use them on the right side of the alias declaration:\ntype Container = { value: T };\n\nWe can also have a type alias refer to itself in a property:\ntype Tree = {\n    value: T;\n    left: Tree;\n    right: Tree;\n}\n\nTogether with intersection types, we can make some pretty mind-bending types:\ntype LinkedList = T & { next: LinkedList };\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n}\n\nvar people: LinkedList;\nvar s = people.name;\nvar s = people.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.name;\nvar s = people.next.next.next.name;\n\nHowever, it's not possible for a type alias to appear anywhere else on the right side of the declaration:\ntype Yikes = Array; // error\n\nInterfaces vs. Type Aliases\nAs we mentioned, type aliases can act sort of like interfaces; however, there are some subtle differences.\nOne difference is that interfaces create a new name that is used everywhere.\nType aliases don't create a new name — for instance, error messages won't use the alias name.\nIn the code below, hovering over interfaced in an editor will show that it returns an Interface, but will show that aliased returns object literal type.\ntype Alias = { num: number }\ninterface Interface {\n    num: number;\n}\ndeclare function aliased(arg: Alias): Alias;\ndeclare function interfaced(arg: Interface): Interface;\n\nA second more important difference is that type aliases cannot be extended or implemented from (nor can they extend/implement other types).\nBecause an ideal property of software is being open to extension, you should always use an interface over a type alias if possible.\nOn the other hand, if you can't express some shape with an interface and you need to use a union or tuple type, type aliases are usually the way to go.\nString Literal Types\nString literal types allow you to specify the exact value a string must have.\nIn practice string literal types combine nicely with union types, type guards, and type aliases.\nYou can use these features together to get enum-like behavior with strings.\ntype Easing = \"ease-in\" | \"ease-out\" | \"ease-in-out\";\nclass UIElement {\n    animate(dx: number, dy: number, easing: Easing) {\n        if (easing === \"ease-in\") {\n            // ...\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-out\") {\n        }\n        else if (easing === \"ease-in-out\") {\n        }\n        else {\n            // error! should not pass null or undefined.\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet button = new UIElement();\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"ease-in\");\nbutton.animate(0, 0, \"uneasy\"); // error: \"uneasy\" is not allowed here\n\nYou can pass any of the three allowed strings, but any other string will give the error\nArgument of type '\"uneasy\"' is not assignable to parameter of type '\"ease-in\" | \"ease-out\" | \"ease-in-out\"'\n\nString literal types can be used in the same way to distinguish overloads:\nfunction createElement(tagName: \"img\"): HTMLImageElement;\nfunction createElement(tagName: \"input\"): HTMLInputElement;\n// ... more overloads ...\nfunction createElement(tagName: string): Element {\n    // ... code goes here ...\n}\n\nNumeric Literal Types\nTypeScript also has numeric literal types.\nfunction rollDie(): 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 {\n    // ...\n}\n\nThese are seldom written explicitly, they can be useful when narrowing can catch bugs:\nfunction foo(x: number) {\n    if (x !== 1 || x !== 2) {\n        //         ~~~~~~~\n        // Operator '!==' cannot be applied to types '1' and '2'.\n    }\n}\n\nIn other words, x must be 1 when it gets compared to 2, meaning that the above check is making an invalid comparison.\nEnum Member Types\nAs mentioned in our section on enums, enum members have types when every member is literal-initialized.\nMuch of the time when we talk about \"singleton types\", we're referring to both enum member types as well as numeric/string literal types, though many users will use \"singleton types\" and \"literal types\" interchangeably.\nDiscriminated Unions\nYou can combine singleton types, union types, type guards, and type aliases to build an advanced pattern called discriminated unions, also known as tagged unions or algebraic data types.\nDiscriminated unions are useful in functional programming.\nSome languages automatically discriminate unions for you; TypeScript instead builds on JavaScript patterns as they exist today.\nThere are three ingredients:\n\nTypes that have a common, singleton type property — the discriminant.\nA type alias that takes the union of those types — the union.\nType guards on the common property.\n\ninterface Square {\n    kind: \"square\";\n    size: number;\n}\ninterface Rectangle {\n    kind: \"rectangle\";\n    width: number;\n    height: number;\n}\ninterface Circle {\n    kind: \"circle\";\n    radius: number;\n}\n\nFirst we declare the interfaces we will union.\nEach interface has a kind property with a different string literal type.\nThe kind property is called the discriminant or tag.\nThe other properties are specific to each interface.\nNotice that the interfaces are currently unrelated.\nLet's put them into a union:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle;\n\nNow let's use the discriminated union:\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\nExhaustiveness checking\nWe would like the compiler to tell us when we don't cover all variants of the discriminated union.\nFor example, if we add Triangle to Shape, we need to update area as well:\ntype Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle | Triangle;\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n    // should error here - we didn't handle case \"triangle\"\n}\n\nThere are two ways to do this.\nThe first is to turn on --strictNullChecks and specify a return type:\nfunction area(s: Shape): number { // error: returns number | undefined\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n    }\n}\n\nBecause the switch is no longer exhaustive, TypeScript is aware that the function could sometimes return undefined.\nIf you have an explicit return type number, then you will get an error that the return type is actually number | undefined.\nHowever, this method is quite subtle and, besides, --strictNullChecks does not always work with old code.\nThe second method uses the never type that the compiler uses to check for exhaustiveness:\nfunction assertNever(x: never): never {\n    throw new Error(\"Unexpected object: \" + x);\n}\nfunction area(s: Shape) {\n    switch (s.kind) {\n        case \"square\": return s.size * s.size;\n        case \"rectangle\": return s.height * s.width;\n        case \"circle\": return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;\n        default: return assertNever(s); // error here if there are missing cases\n    }\n}\n\nHere, assertNever checks that s is of type never — the type that's left after all other cases have been removed.\nIf you forget a case, then s will have a real type and you will get a type error.\nThis method requires you to define an extra function, but it's much more obvious when you forget it.\nPolymorphic this types\nA polymorphic this type represents a type that is the subtype of the containing class or interface.\nThis is called F-bounded polymorphism.\nThis makes hierarchical fluent interfaces much easier to express, for example.\nTake a simple calculator that returns this after each operation:\nclass BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(protected value: number = 0) { }\n    public currentValue(): number {\n        return this.value;\n    }\n    public add(operand: number): this {\n        this.value += operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    public multiply(operand: number): this {\n        this.value *= operand;\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... other operations go here ...\n}\n\nlet v = new BasicCalculator(2)\n            .multiply(5)\n            .add(1)\n            .currentValue();\n\nSince the class uses this types, you can extend it and the new class can use the old methods with no changes.\nclass ScientificCalculator extends BasicCalculator {\n    public constructor(value = 0) {\n        super(value);\n    }\n    public sin() {\n        this.value = Math.sin(this.value);\n        return this;\n    }\n    // ... other operations go here ...\n}\n\nlet v = new ScientificCalculator(2)\n        .multiply(5)\n        .sin()\n        .add(1)\n        .currentValue();\n\nWithout this types, ScientificCalculator would not have been able to extend BasicCalculator and keep the fluent interface.\nmultiply would have returned BasicCalculator, which doesn't have the sin method.\nHowever, with this types, multiply returns this, which is ScientificCalculator here.\nIndex types\nWith index types, you can get the compiler to check code that uses dynamic property names.\nFor example, a common Javascript pattern is to pick a subset of properties from an object:\nfunction pluck(o, names) {\n    return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\nHere's how you would write and use this function in TypeScript, using the index type query and indexed access operators:\nfunction pluck(o: T, names: K[]): T[K][] {\n  return names.map(n => o[n]);\n}\n\ninterface Person {\n    name: string;\n    age: number;\n}\nlet person: Person = {\n    name: 'Jarid',\n    age: 35\n};\nlet strings: string[] = pluck(person, ['name']); // ok, string[]\n\nThe compiler checks that name is actually a property on Person.\nThe example introduces a couple of new type operators.\nFirst is keyof T, the index type query operator.\nFor any type T, keyof T is the union of known, public property names of T.\nFor example:\nlet personProps: keyof Person; // 'name' | 'age'\n\nkeyof Person is completely interchangeable with 'name' | 'age'.\nThe difference is that if you add another property to Person, say address: string, then keyof Person will automatically update to be 'name' | 'age' | 'address'.\nAnd you can use keyof in generic contexts like pluck, where you can't possibly know the property names ahead of time.\nThat means the compiler will check that you pass the right set of property names to pluck:\npluck(person, ['age', 'unknown']); // error, 'unknown' is not in 'name' | 'age'\n\nThe second operator is T[K], the indexed access operator.\nHere, the type syntax reflects the expression syntax.\nThat means that person['name'] has the type Person['name'] — which in our example is just string.\nHowever, just like index type queries, you can use T[K] in a generic context, which is where its real power comes to life.\nYou just have to make sure that the type variable K extends keyof T.\nHere's another example with a function named getProperty.\nfunction getProperty(o: T, name: K): T[K] {\n    return o[name]; // o[name] is of type T[K]\n}\n\nIn getProperty, o: T and name: K, so that means o[name]: T[K].\nOnce you return the T[K] result, the compiler will instantiate the actual type of the key, so the return type of getProperty will vary according to which property you request.\nlet name: string = getProperty(person, 'name');\nlet age: number = getProperty(person, 'age');\nlet unknown = getProperty(person, 'unknown'); // error, 'unknown' is not in 'name' | 'age'\n\nIndex types and string index signatures\nkeyof and T[K] interact with string index signatures.\nIf you have a type with a string index signature, keyof T will just be string.\nAnd T[string] is just the type of the index signature:\ninterface Map {\n    [key: string]: T;\n}\nlet keys: keyof Map; // string\nlet value: Map['foo']; // number\n\nMapped types\nA common task is to take an existing type and make each of its properties optional:\ninterface PersonPartial {\n    name?: string;\n    age?: number;\n}\n\nOr we might want a readonly version:\ninterface PersonReadonly {\n    readonly name: string;\n    readonly age: number;\n}\n\nThis happens often enough in Javascript that TypeScript provides a way to create new types based on old types — mapped types.\nIn a mapped type, the new type transforms each property in the old type in the same way.\nFor example, you can make all properties of a type readonly or optional.\nHere are a couple of examples:\ntype Readonly = {\n    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n}\ntype Partial = {\n    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];\n}\n\nAnd to use it:\ntype PersonPartial = Partial;\ntype ReadonlyPerson = Readonly;\n\nLet's take a look at the simplest mapped type and its parts:\ntype Keys = 'option1' | 'option2';\ntype Flags = { [K in Keys]: boolean };\n\nThe syntax resembles the syntax for index signatures with a for .. in inside.\nThere are three parts:\n\nThe type variable K, which gets bound to each property in turn.\nThe string literal union Keys, which contains the names of properties to iterate over.\nThe resulting type of the property.\n\nIn this simple example, Keys is a hard-coded list of property names and the property type is always boolean, so this mapped type is equivalent to writing:\ntype Flags = {\n    option1: boolean;\n    option2: boolean;\n}\n\nReal applications, however, look like Readonly or Partial above.\nThey're based on some existing type, and they transform the properties in some way.\nThat's where keyof and indexed access types come in:\ntype NullablePerson = { [P in keyof Person]: Person[P] | null }\ntype PartialPerson = { [P in keyof Person]?: Person[P] }\n\nBut it's more useful to have a general version.\ntype Nullable = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null }\ntype Partial = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] }\n\nIn these examples, the properties list is keyof T and the resulting type is some variant of T[P].\nThis is a good template for any general use of mapped types.\nThat's because this kind of transformation is homomorphic, which means that the mapping applies only to properties of T and no others.\nThe compiler knows that it can copy all the existing property modifiers before adding any new ones.\nFor example, if Person.name was readonly, Partial.name would be readonly and optional.\nHere's one more example, in which T[P] is wrapped in a Proxy class:\ntype Proxy = {\n    get(): T;\n    set(value: T): void;\n}\ntype Proxify = {\n    [P in keyof T]: Proxy;\n}\nfunction proxify(o: T): Proxify {\n   // ... wrap proxies ...\n}\nlet proxyProps = proxify(props);\n\nNote that Readonly and Partial are so useful, they are included in TypeScript's standard library along with Pick and Record:\ntype Pick = {\n    [P in K]: T[P];\n}\ntype Record = {\n    [P in K]: T;\n}\n\nReadonly, Partial and Pick are homomorphic whereas Record is not.\nOne clue that Record is not homomorphic is that it doesn't take an input type to copy properties from:\ntype ThreeStringProps = Record\n\nNon-homomorphic types are essentially creating new properties, so they can't copy property modifiers from anywhere.\nInference from mapped types\nNow that you know how to wrap the properties of a type, the next thing you'll want to do is unwrap them.\nFortunately, that's pretty easy:\nfunction unproxify(t: Proxify): T {\n    let result = {} as T;\n    for (const k in t) {\n        result[k] = t[k].get();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nlet originalProps = unproxify(proxyProps);\n\nNote that this unwrapping inference only works on homomorphic mapped types.\nIf the mapped type is not homomorphic you'll have to give an explicit type parameter to your

TypeScript shares this concept.\nModules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms.\nConversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.\nModules are declarative; the relationships between modules are specified in terms of imports and exports at the file level.\nModules import one another using a module loader.\nAt runtime the module loader is responsible for locating and executing all dependencies of a module before executing it.\nWell-known modules loaders used in JavaScript are the CommonJS module loader for Node.js and require.js for Web applications.\nIn TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module.\nConversely, a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).\nExport\nExporting a declaration\nAny declaration (such as a variable, function, class, type alias, or interface) can be exported by adding the export keyword.\nValidation.ts\nexport interface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nExport statements\nExport statements are handy when exports need to be renamed for consumers, so the above example can be written as:\nclass ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\nexport { ZipCodeValidator };\nexport { ZipCodeValidator as mainValidator };\n\nRe-exports\nOften modules extend other modules, and partially expose some of their features.\nA re-export does not import it locally, or introduce a local variable.\nParseIntBasedZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport class ParseIntBasedZipCodeValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && parseInt(s).toString() === s;\n    }\n}\n\n// Export original validator but rename it\nexport {ZipCodeValidator as RegExpBasedZipCodeValidator} from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nOptionally, a module can wrap one or more modules and combine all their exports using export * from \"module\" syntax.\nAllValidators.ts\nexport * from \"./StringValidator\"; // exports interface 'StringValidator'\nexport * from \"./LettersOnlyValidator\"; // exports class 'LettersOnlyValidator'\nexport * from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";  // exports class 'ZipCodeValidator'\n\nImport\nImporting is just about as easy as exporting from a module.\nImporting an exported declaration is done through using one of the import forms below:\nImport a single export from a module\nimport { ZipCodeValidator } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet myValidator = new ZipCodeValidator();\n\nimports can also be renamed\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as ZCV } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nlet myValidator = new ZCV();\n\nImport the entire module into a single variable, and use it to access the module exports\nimport * as validator from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nlet myValidator = new validator.ZipCodeValidator();\n\nImport a module for side-effects only\nThough not recommended practice, some modules set up some global state that can be used by other modules.\nThese modules may not have any exports, or the consumer is not interested in any of their exports.\nTo import these modules, use:\nimport \"./my-module.js\";\n\nDefault exports\nEach module can optionally export a default export.\nDefault exports are marked with the keyword default; and there can only be one default export per module.\ndefault exports are imported using a different import form.\ndefault exports are really handy.\nFor instance, a library like JQuery might have a default export of jQuery or $, which we'd probably also import under the name $ or jQuery.\nJQuery.d.ts\ndeclare let $: JQuery;\nexport default $;\n\nApp.ts\nimport $ from \"JQuery\";\n\n$(\"button.continue\").html( \"Next Step...\" );\n\nClasses and function declarations can be authored directly as default exports.\nDefault export class and function declaration names are optional.\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nexport default class ZipCodeValidator {\n    static numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && ZipCodeValidator.numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport validator from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet myValidator = new validator();\n\nor\nStaticZipCodeValidator.ts\nconst numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport default function (s: string) {\n    return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport validate from \"./StaticZipCodeValidator\";\n\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Use function validate\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n  console.log(`\"${s}\" ${validate(s) ? \" matches\" : \" does not match\"}`);\n});\n\ndefault exports can also be just values:\nOneTwoThree.ts\nexport default \"123\";\n\nLog.ts\nimport num from \"./OneTwoThree\";\n\nconsole.log(num); // \"123\"\n\nexport = and import = require()\nBoth CommonJS and AMD generally have the concept of an exports object which contains all exports from a module.\nThey also support replacing the exports object with a custom single object.\nDefault exports are meant to act as a replacement for this behavior; however, the two are incompatible.\nTypeScript supports export = to model the traditional CommonJS and AMD workflow.\nThe export = syntax specifies a single object that is exported from the module.\nThis can be a class, interface, namespace, function, or enum.\nWhen exporting a module using export =, TypeScript-specific import module = require(\"module\") must be used to import the module.\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nlet numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\nclass ZipCodeValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\nexport = ZipCodeValidator;\n\nTest.ts\nimport zip = require(\"./ZipCodeValidator\");\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validator = new zip();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n  console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validator.isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" }`);\n});\n\nCode Generation for Modules\nDepending on the module target specified during compilation, the compiler will generate appropriate code for Node.js (CommonJS), require.js (AMD), UMD, SystemJS, or ECMAScript 2015 native modules (ES6) module-loading systems.\nFor more information on what the define, require and register calls in the generated code do, consult the documentation for each module loader.\nThis simple example shows how the names used during importing and exporting get translated into the module loading code.\nSimpleModule.ts\nimport m = require(\"mod\");\nexport let t = m.something + 1;\n\nAMD / RequireJS SimpleModule.js\ndefine([\"require\", \"exports\", \"./mod\"], function (require, exports, mod_1) {\n    exports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n});\n\nCommonJS / Node SimpleModule.js\nvar mod_1 = require(\"./mod\");\nexports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n\nUMD SimpleModule.js\n(function (factory) {\n    if (typeof module === \"object\" && typeof module.exports === \"object\") {\n        var v = factory(require, exports); if (v !== undefined) module.exports = v;\n    }\n    else if (typeof define === \"function\" && define.amd) {\n        define([\"require\", \"exports\", \"./mod\"], factory);\n    }\n})(function (require, exports) {\n    var mod_1 = require(\"./mod\");\n    exports.t = mod_1.something + 1;\n});\n\nSystem SimpleModule.js\nSystem.register([\"./mod\"], function(exports_1) {\n    var mod_1;\n    var t;\n    return {\n        setters:[\n            function (mod_1_1) {\n                mod_1 = mod_1_1;\n            }],\n        execute: function() {\n            exports_1(\"t\", t = mod_1.something + 1);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nNative ECMAScript 2015 modules SimpleModule.js\nimport { something } from \"./mod\";\nexport var t = something + 1;\n\nSimple Example\nBelow, we've consolidated the Validator implementations used in previous examples to only export a single named export from each module.\nTo compile, we must specify a module target on the command line. For Node.js, use --module commonjs;\nfor require.js, use --module amd. For example:\ntsc --module commonjs Test.ts\n\nWhen compiled, each module will become a separate .js file.\nAs with reference tags, the compiler will follow import statements to compile dependent files.\nValidation.ts\nexport interface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nLettersOnlyValidator.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\n\nconst lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n\nexport class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\n\nconst numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nexport class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\nimport { StringValidator } from \"./Validation\";\nimport { ZipCodeValidator } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\nimport { LettersOnlyValidator } from \"./LettersOnlyValidator\";\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nstrings.forEach(s => {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n});\n\nOptional Module Loading and Other Advanced Loading Scenarios\nIn some cases, you may want to only load a module under some conditions.\nIn TypeScript, we can use the pattern shown below to implement this and other advanced loading scenarios to directly invoke the module loaders without losing type safety.\nThe compiler detects whether each module is used in the emitted JavaScript.\nIf a module identifier is only ever used as part of a type annotations and never as an expression, then no require call is emitted for that module.\nThis elision of unused references is a good performance optimization, and also allows for optional loading of those modules.\nThe core idea of the pattern is that the import id = require(\"...\") statement gives us access to the types exposed by the module.\nThe module loader is invoked (through require) dynamically, as shown in the if blocks below.\nThis leverages the reference-elision optimization so that the module is only loaded when needed.\nFor this pattern to work, it's important that the symbol defined via an import is only used in type positions (i.e. never in a position that would be emitted into the JavaScript).\nTo maintain type safety, we can use the typeof keyword.\nThe typeof keyword, when used in a type position, produces the type of a value, in this case the type of the module.\nDynamic Module Loading in Node.js\ndeclare function require(moduleName: string): any;\n\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as Zip } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    let ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip = require(\"./ZipCodeValidator\");\n    let validator = new ZipCodeValidator();\n    if (validator.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nSample: Dynamic Module Loading in require.js\ndeclare function require(moduleNames: string[], onLoad: (...args: any[]) => void): void;\n\nimport * as Zip from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    require([\"./ZipCodeValidator\"], (ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip) => {\n        let validator = new ZipCodeValidator.ZipCodeValidator();\n        if (validator.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n    });\n}\n\nSample: Dynamic Module Loading in System.js\ndeclare const System: any;\n\nimport { ZipCodeValidator as Zip } from \"./ZipCodeValidator\";\n\nif (needZipValidation) {\n    System.import(\"./ZipCodeValidator\").then((ZipCodeValidator: typeof Zip) => {\n        var x = new ZipCodeValidator();\n        if (x.isAcceptable(\"...\")) { /* ... */ }\n    });\n}\n\nWorking with Other JavaScript Libraries\nTo describe the shape of libraries not written in TypeScript, we need to declare the API that the library exposes.\nWe call declarations that don't define an implementation \"ambient\".\nTypically, these are defined in .d.ts files.\nIf you're familiar with C/C++, you can think of these as .h files.\nLet's look at a few examples.\nAmbient Modules\nIn Node.js, most tasks are accomplished by loading one or more modules.\nWe could define each module in its own .d.ts file with top-level export declarations, but it's more convenient to write them as one larger .d.ts file.\nTo do so, we use a construct similar to ambient namespaces, but we use the module keyword and the quoted name of the module which will be available to a later import.\nFor example:\nnode.d.ts (simplified excerpt)\ndeclare module \"url\" {\n    export interface Url {\n        protocol?: string;\n        hostname?: string;\n        pathname?: string;\n    }\n\n    export function parse(urlStr: string, parseQueryString?, slashesDenoteHost?): Url;\n}\n\ndeclare module \"path\" {\n    export function normalize(p: string): string;\n    export function join(...paths: any[]): string;\n    export var sep: string;\n}\n\nNow we can ///  node.d.ts and then load the modules using import url = require(\"url\"); or import * as URL from \"url\".\n/// \nimport * as URL from \"url\";\nlet myUrl = URL.parse(\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\");\n\nShorthand ambient modules\nIf you don't want to take the time to write out declarations before using a new module, you can use a shorthand declaration to get started quickly.\ndeclarations.d.ts\ndeclare module \"hot-new-module\";\n\nAll imports from a shorthand module will have the any type.\nimport x, {y} from \"hot-new-module\";\nx(y);\n\nWildcard module declarations\nSome module loaders such as SystemJS\nand AMD allow non-JavaScript content to be imported.\nThese typically use a prefix or suffix to indicate the special loading semantics.\nWildcard module declarations can be used to cover these cases.\ndeclare module \"*!text\" {\n    const content: string;\n    export default content;\n}\n// Some do it the other way around.\ndeclare module \"json!*\" {\n    const value: any;\n    export default value;\n}\n\nNow you can import things that match \"*!text\" or \"json!*\".\nimport fileContent from \"./xyz.txt!text\";\nimport data from \"json!http://example.com/data.json\";\nconsole.log(data, fileContent);\n\nUMD modules\nSome libraries are designed to be used in many module loaders, or with no module loading (global variables).\nThese are known as UMD modules.\nThese libraries can be accessed through either an import or a global variable.\nFor example:\nmath-lib.d.ts\nexport function isPrime(x: number): boolean;\nexport as namespace mathLib;\n\nThe library can then be used as an import within modules:\nimport { isPrime } from \"math-lib\";\nisPrime(2);\nmathLib.isPrime(2); // ERROR: can't use the global definition from inside a module\n\nIt can also be used as a global variable, but only inside of a script.\n(A script is a file with no imports or exports.)\nmathLib.isPrime(2);\n\nGuidance for structuring modules\nExport as close to top-level as possible\nConsumers of your module should have as little friction as possible when using things that you export.\nAdding too many levels of nesting tends to be cumbersome, so think carefully about how you want to structure things.\nExporting a namespace from your module is an example of adding too many layers of nesting.\nWhile namespaces sometime have their uses, they add an extra level of indirection when using modules.\nThis can quickly become a pain point for users, and is usually unnecessary.\nStatic methods on an exported class have a similar problem - the class itself adds a layer of nesting.\nUnless it increases expressivity or intent in a clearly useful way, consider simply exporting a helper function.\nIf you're only exporting a single class or function, use export default\nJust as \"exporting near the top-level\" reduces friction on your module's consumers, so does introducing a default export.\nIf a module's primary purpose is to house one specific export, then you should consider exporting it as a default export.\nThis makes both importing and actually using the import a little easier.\nFor example:\nMyClass.ts\nexport default class SomeType {\n  constructor() { ... }\n}\n\nMyFunc.ts\nexport default function getThing() { return \"thing\"; }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport t from \"./MyClass\";\nimport f from \"./MyFunc\";\nlet x = new t();\nconsole.log(f());\n\nThis is optimal for consumers. They can name your type whatever they want (t in this case) and don't have to do any excessive dotting to find your objects.\nIf you're exporting multiple objects, put them all at top-level\nMyThings.ts\nexport class SomeType { /* ... */ }\nexport function someFunc() { /* ... */ }\n\nConversely when importing:\nExplicitly list imported names\nConsumer.ts\nimport { SomeType, someFunc } from \"./MyThings\";\nlet x = new SomeType();\nlet y = someFunc();\n\nUse the namespace import pattern if you're importing a large number of things\nMyLargeModule.ts\nexport class Dog { ... }\nexport class Cat { ... }\nexport class Tree { ... }\nexport class Flower { ... }\n\nConsumer.ts\nimport * as myLargeModule from \"./MyLargeModule.ts\";\nlet x = new myLargeModule.Dog();\n\nRe-export to extend\nOften you will need to extend functionality on a module.\nA common JS pattern is to augment the original object with extensions, similar to how JQuery extensions work.\nAs we've mentioned before, modules do not merge like global namespace objects would.\nThe recommended solution is to not mutate the original object, but rather export a new entity that provides the new functionality.\nConsider a simple calculator implementation defined in module Calculator.ts.\nThe module also exports a helper function to test the calculator functionality by passing a list of input strings and writing the result at the end.\nCalculator.ts\nexport class Calculator {\n    private current = 0;\n    private memory = 0;\n    private operator: string;\n\n    protected processDigit(digit: string, currentValue: number) {\n        if (digit >= \"0\" && digit = 0) {\n            return operator;\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected evaluateOperator(operator: string, left: number, right: number): number {\n        switch (this.operator) {\n            case \"+\": return left + right;\n            case \"-\": return left - right;\n            case \"*\": return left * right;\n            case \"/\": return left / right;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private evaluate() {\n        if (this.operator) {\n            this.memory = this.evaluateOperator(this.operator, this.memory, this.current);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.memory = this.current;\n        }\n        this.current = 0;\n    }\n\n    public handleChar(char: string) {\n        if (char === \"=\") {\n            this.evaluate();\n            return;\n        }\n        else {\n            let value = this.processDigit(char, this.current);\n            if (value !== undefined) {\n                this.current = value;\n                return;\n            }\n            else {\n                let value = this.processOperator(char);\n                if (value !== undefined) {\n                    this.evaluate();\n                    this.operator = value;\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported input: '${char}'`);\n    }\n\n    public getResult() {\n        return this.memory;\n    }\n}\n\nexport function test(c: Calculator, input: string) {\n    for (let i = 0;

// prints 3\n\nDo not use namespaces in modules\nWhen first moving to a module-based organization, a common tendency is to wrap exports in an additional layer of namespaces.\nModules have their own scope, and only exported declarations are visible from outside the module.\nWith this in mind, namespace provide very little, if any, value when working with modules.\nOn the organization front, namespaces are handy for grouping together logically-related objects and types in the global scope.\nFor example, in C#, you're going to find all the collection types in System.Collections.\nBy organizing our types into hierarchical namespaces, we provide a good \"discovery\" experience for users of those types.\nModules, on the other hand, are already present in a file system, necessarily.\nWe have to resolve them by path and filename, so there's a logical organization scheme for us to use.\nWe can have a /collections/generic/ folder with a list module in it.\nNamespaces are important to avoid naming collisions in the global scope.\nFor example, you might have My.Application.Customer.AddForm and My.Application.Order.AddForm -- two types with the same name, but a different namespace.\nThis, however, is not an issue with modules.\nWithin a module, there's no plausible reason to have two objects with the same name.\nFrom the consumption side, the consumer of any given module gets to pick the name that they will use to refer to the module, so accidental naming conflicts are impossible.\n\nFor more discussion about modules and namespaces see Namespaces and Modules.\n\nRed Flags\nAll of the following are red flags for module structuring. Double-check that you're not trying to namespace your external modules if any of these apply to your files:\n\nA file whose only top-level declaration is export namespace Foo { ... } (remove Foo and move everything 'up' a level)\nA file that has a single export class or export function (consider using export default)\nMultiple files that have the same export namespace Foo { at top-level (don't think that these are going to combine into one Foo!)\n\n"},"pages/Namespaces.html":{"url":"pages/Namespaces.html","title":"Namespaces","keywords":"","body":"\nA note about terminology:\nIt's important to note that in TypeScript 1.5, the nomenclature has changed.\n\"Internal modules\" are now \"namespaces\".\n\"External modules\" are now simply \"modules\", as to align with ECMAScript 2015's terminology, (namely that module X { is equivalent to the now-preferred namespace X {).\n\nIntroduction\nThis post outlines the various ways to organize your code using namespaces (previously \"internal modules\") in TypeScript.\nAs we alluded in our note about terminology, \"internal modules\" are now referred to as \"namespaces\".\nAdditionally, anywhere the module keyword was used when declaring an internal module, the namespace keyword can and should be used instead.\nThis avoids confusing new users by overloading them with similarly named terms.\nFirst steps\nLet's start with the program we'll be using as our example throughout this page.\nWe've written a small set of simplistic string validators, as you might write to check a user's input on a form in a webpage or check the format of an externally-provided data file.\nValidators in a single file\ninterface StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n}\n\nlet lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\nlet numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\nclass LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\nclass ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n    isAcceptable(s: string) {\n        return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n    }\n}\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        let isMatch = validators[name].isAcceptable(s);\n        console.log(`'${ s }' ${ isMatch ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } '${ name }'.`);\n    }\n}\n\nNamespacing\nAs we add more validators, we're going to want to have some kind of organization scheme so that we can keep track of our types and not worry about name collisions with other objects.\nInstead of putting lots of different names into the global namespace, let's wrap up our objects into a namespace.\nIn this example, we'll move all validator-related entities into a namespace called Validation.\nBecause we want the interfaces and classes here to be visible outside the namespace, we preface them with export.\nConversely, the variables lettersRegexp and numberRegexp are implementation details, so they are left unexported and will not be visible to code outside the namespace.\nIn the test code at the bottom of the file, we now need to qualify the names of the types when used outside the namespace, e.g. Validation.LettersOnlyValidator.\nNamespaced Validators\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n\n    const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n    const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n\n    export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n\n    export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n}\n\nSplitting Across Files\nAs our application grows, we'll want to split the code across multiple files to make it easier to maintain.\nMulti-file namespaces\nHere, we'll split our Validation namespace across many files.\nEven though the files are separate, they can each contribute to the same namespace and can be consumed as if they were all defined in one place.\nBecause there are dependencies between files, we'll add reference tags to tell the compiler about the relationships between the files.\nOur test code is otherwise unchanged.\nValidation.ts\nnamespace Validation {\n    export interface StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;\n    }\n}\n\nLettersOnlyValidator.ts\n/// \nnamespace Validation {\n    const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;\n    export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return lettersRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nZipCodeValidator.ts\n/// \nnamespace Validation {\n    const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;\n    export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {\n        isAcceptable(s: string) {\n            return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTest.ts\n/// \n/// \n/// \n\n// Some samples to try\nlet strings = [\"Hello\", \"98052\", \"101\"];\n\n// Validators to use\nlet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator; } = {};\nvalidators[\"ZIP code\"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();\nvalidators[\"Letters only\"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();\n\n// Show whether each string passed each validator\nfor (let s of strings) {\n    for (let name in validators) {\n        console.log(`\"${ s }\" - ${ validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? \"matches\" : \"does not match\" } ${ name }`);\n    }\n}\n\nOnce there are multiple files involved, we'll need to make sure all of the compiled code gets loaded.\nThere are two ways of doing this.\nFirst, we can use concatenated output using the --outFile flag to compile all of the input files into a single JavaScript output file:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Test.ts\n\nThe compiler will automatically order the output file based on the reference tags present in the files. You can also specify each file individually:\ntsc --outFile sample.js Validation.ts LettersOnlyValidator.ts ZipCodeValidator.ts Test.ts\n\nAlternatively, we can use per-file compilation (the default) to emit one JavaScript file for each input file.\nIf multiple JS files get produced, we'll need to use  tags on our webpage to load each emitted file in the appropriate order, for example:\nMyTestPage.html (excerpt)\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nAliases\nAnother way that you can simplify working with of namespaces is to use import q = x.y.z to create shorter names for commonly-used objects.\nNot to be confused with the import x = require(\"name\") syntax used to load modules, this syntax simply creates an alias for the specified symbol.\nYou can use these sorts of imports (commonly referred to as aliases) for any kind of identifier, including objects created from module imports.\nnamespace Shapes {\n    export namespace Polygons {\n        export class Triangle { }\n        export class Square { }\n    }\n}\n\nimport polygons = Shapes.Polygons;\nlet sq = new polygons.Square(); // Same as 'new Shapes.Polygons.Square()'\n\nNotice that we don't use the require keyword; instead we assign directly from the qualified name of the symbol we're importing.\nThis is similar to using var, but also works on the type and namespace meanings of the imported symbol.\nImportantly, for values, import is a distinct reference from the original symbol, so changes to an aliased var will not be reflected in the original variable.\nWorking with Other JavaScript Libraries\nTo describe the shape of libraries not written in TypeScript, we need to declare the API that the library exposes.\nBecause most JavaScript libraries expose only a few top-level objects, namespaces are a good way to represent them.\nWe call declarations that don't define an implementation \"ambient\".\nTypically these are defined in .d.ts files.\nIf you're familiar with C/C++, you can think of these as .h files.\nLet's look at a few examples.\nAmbient Namespaces\nThe popular library D3 defines its functionality in a global object called d3.\nBecause this library is loaded through a  tag (instead of a module loader), its declaration uses namespaces to define its shape.\nFor the TypeScript compiler to see this shape, we use an ambient namespace declaration.\nFor example, we could begin writing it as follows:\nD3.d.ts (simplified excerpt)\ndeclare namespace D3 {\n    export interface Selectors {\n        select: {\n            (selector: string): Selection;\n            (element: EventTarget): Selection;\n        };\n    }\n\n    export interface Event {\n        x: number;\n        y: number;\n    }\n\n    export interface Base extends Selectors {\n        event: Event;\n    }\n}\n\ndeclare var d3: D3.Base;\n\n"},"pages/Namespaces and Modules.html":{"url":"pages/Namespaces and Modules.html","title":"Namespaces and Modules","keywords":"","body":"\nA note about

namespaces and modules in TypeScript.\nWe'll also go over some advanced topics of how to use namespaces and modules, and address some common pitfalls when using them in TypeScript.\nSee the Modules documentation for more information about modules.\nSee the Namespaces documentation for more information about namespaces.\nUsing Namespaces\nNamespaces are simply named JavaScript objects in the global namespace.\nThis makes namespaces a very simple construct to use.\nThey can span multiple files, and can be concatenated using --outFile.\nNamespaces can be a good way to structure your code in a Web Application, with all dependencies included as  tags in your HTML page.\nJust like all global namespace pollution, it can be hard to identify component dependencies, especially in a large application.\nUsing Modules\nJust like namespaces, modules can contain both code and declarations.\nThe main difference is that modules declare their dependencies.\nModules also have a dependency on a module loader (such as CommonJs/Require.js).\nFor a small JS application this might not be optimal, but for larger applications, the cost comes with long term modularity and maintainability benefits.\nModules provide for better code reuse, stronger isolation and better tooling support for bundling.\nIt is also worth noting that, for Node.js applications, modules are the default and the recommended approach to structure your code.\nStarting with ECMAScript 2015, modules are native part of the language, and should be supported by all compliant engine implementations.\nThus, for new projects modules would be the recommended code organization mechanism.\nPitfalls of Namespaces and Modules\nIn this section we'll describe various common pitfalls in using namespaces and modules, and how to avoid them.\n/// -ing a module\nA common mistake is to try to use the ///  syntax to refer to a module file, rather than using an import statement.\nTo understand the distinction, we first need to understand how the compiler can locate the type information for a module based on the path of an import (e.g. the ... in import x from \"...\";, import x = require(\"...\");, etc.) path.\nThe compiler will try to find a .ts, .tsx, and then a .d.ts with the appropriate path.\nIf a specific file could not be found, then the compiler will look for an ambient module declaration.\nRecall that these need to be declared in a .d.ts file.\n\nmyModules.d.ts\n// In a .d.ts file or .ts file that is not a module:\ndeclare module \"SomeModule\" {\n    export function fn(): string;\n}\n\n\nmyOtherModule.ts\n/// \nimport * as m from \"SomeModule\";\n\n\n\nThe reference tag here allows us to locate the declaration file that contains the declaration for the ambient module.\nThis is how the node.d.ts file that several of the TypeScript samples use is consumed.\nNeedless Namespacing\nIf you're converting a program from namespaces to modules, it can be easy to end up with a file that looks like this:\n\nshapes.ts\nexport namespace Shapes {\n    export class Triangle { /* ... */ }\n    export class Square { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n\n\nThe top-level module here Shapes wraps up Triangle and Square for no reason.\nThis is confusing and annoying for consumers of your module:\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Shapes.Triangle(); // shapes.Shapes?\n\n\n\nA key feature of modules in TypeScript is that two different modules will never contribute names to the same scope.\nBecause the consumer of a module decides what name to assign it, there's no need to proactively wrap up the exported symbols in a namespace.\nTo reiterate why you shouldn't try to namespace your module contents, the general idea of namespacing is to provide logical grouping of constructs and to prevent name collisions.\nBecause the module file itself is already a logical grouping, and its top-level name is defined by the code that imports it, it's unnecessary to use an additional module layer for exported objects.\nHere's a revised example:\n\nshapes.ts\nexport class Triangle { /* ... */ }\nexport class Square { /* ... */ }\n\n\nshapeConsumer.ts\nimport * as shapes from \"./shapes\";\nlet t = new shapes.Triangle();\n\n\n\nTrade-offs of Modules\nJust as there is a one-to-one correspondence between JS files and modules, TypeScript has a one-to-one correspondence between module source files and their emitted JS files.\nOne effect of this is that it's not possible to concatenate multiple module source files depending on the module system you target.\nFor instance, you can't use the outFile option while targeting commonjs or umd, but with TypeScript 1.8 and later, it's possible to use outFile when targeting amd or system.\n"},"pages/Module Resolution.html":{"url":"pages/Module Resolution.html","title":"Module Resolution","keywords":"","body":"\nThis section assumes some basic knowledge about modules.\nPlease see the Modules documentation for more information.\n\nModule resolution is the process the compiler uses to figure out what an import refers to.\nConsider an import statement like import { a } from \"moduleA\";\nin order to check any use of a, the compiler needs to know exactly what it represents, and will need to check its definition moduleA.\nAt this point, the compiler will ask \"what's the shape of moduleA?\"\nWhile this sounds straightforward, moduleA could be defined in one of your own .ts/.tsx files, or in a .d.ts that your code depends on.\nFirst, the compiler will try to locate a file that represents the imported module.\nTo do so the compiler follows one of two different strategies: Classic or Node.\nThese strategies tell the compiler where to look for moduleA.\nIf that didn't work and if the module name is non-relative (and in the case of \"moduleA\", it is), then the compiler will attempt to locate an ambient module declaration.\nWe'll cover non-relative imports next.\nFinally, if the compiler could not resolve the module, it will log an error.\nIn this case, the error would be something like error TS2307: Cannot find module 'moduleA'.\nRelative vs. Non-relative module imports\nModule imports are resolved differently based on whether the module reference is relative or non-relative.\nA relative import is one that starts with /, ./ or ../.\nSome examples include:\n\nimport Entry from \"./components/Entry\";\nimport { DefaultHeaders } from \"../constants/http\";\nimport \"/mod\";\n\nAny other import is considered non-relative.\nSome examples include:\n\nimport * as $ from \"jquery\";\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\nA relative import is resolved relative to the importing file and cannot resolve to an ambient module declaration.\nYou should use relative imports for your own modules that are guaranteed to maintain their relative location at runtime.\nA non-relative import can be resolved relative to baseUrl, or through path mapping, which we'll cover below.\nThey can also resolve to ambient module declarations.\nUse non-relative paths when importing any of your external dependencies.\nModule Resolution Strategies\nThere are two possible module resolution strategies: Node and Classic.\nYou can use the --moduleResolution flag to specify the module resolution strategy.\nIf not specified, the default is Classic for --module AMD | System | ES2015 or Node otherwise.\nClassic\nThis used to be TypeScript's default resolution strategy.\nNowadays, this strategy is mainly present for backward compatibility.\nA relative import will be resolved relative to the importing file.\nSo import { b } from \"./moduleB\" in source file /root/src/folder/A.ts would result in the following lookups:\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n\nFor non-relative module imports, however, the compiler walks up the directory tree starting with the directory containing the importing file, trying to locate a matching definition file.\nFor example:\nA non-relative import to moduleB such as import { b } from \"moduleB\", in a source file /root/src/folder/A.ts, would result in attempting the following locations for locating \"moduleB\":\n\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/folder/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/moduleB.ts\n/root/moduleB.d.ts\n/moduleB.ts\n/moduleB.d.ts\n\nNode\nThis resolution strategy attempts to mimic the Node.js module resolution mechanism at runtime.\nThe full Node.js resolution algorithm is outlined in Node.js module documentation.\nHow Node.js resolves modules\nTo understand what steps the TS compiler will follow, it is important to shed some light on Node.js modules.\nTraditionally, imports in Node.js are performed by calling a function named require.\nThe behavior Node.js takes will differ depending on if require is given a relative path or a non-relative path.\nRelative paths are fairly straightforward.\nAs an example, let's consider a file located at /root/src/moduleA.js, which contains the import var x = require(\"./moduleB\");\nNode.js resolves that import in the following order:\n\nAsk the file named /root/src/moduleB.js, if it exists.\n\nAsk the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named package.json that specifies a \"main\" module.\nIn our example, if Node.js found the file /root/src/moduleB/package.json containing { \"main\": \"lib/mainModule.js\" }, then Node.js will refer to /root/src/moduleB/lib/mainModule.js.\n\nAsk the folder /root/src/moduleB if it contains a file named index.js.\nThat file is implicitly considered that folder's \"main\" module.\n\n\nYou can read more about this in Node.js documentation on file modules and folder modules.\nHowever, resolution for a non-relative module name is performed differently.\nNode will look for your modules in special folders named node_modules.\nA node_modules folder can be on the same level as the current file, or higher up in the directory chain.\nNode will walk up the directory chain, looking through each node_modules until it finds the module you tried to load.\nFollowing up our example above, consider if /root/src/moduleA.js instead used a non-relative path and had the import var x = require(\"moduleB\");.\nNode would then try to resolve moduleB to each of the locations until one worked.\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\n/node_modules/moduleB.js\n/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"main\" property)\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.js\n\nNotice that Node.js jumped up a directory in steps (4) and (7).\nYou can read more about the process in Node.js documentation on loading modules from node_modules.\nHow TypeScript resolves modules\nTypeScript will mimic the Node.js run-time resolution strategy in order to locate definition files for modules at compile-time.\nTo accomplish this, TypeScript overlays the TypeScript source file extensions (.ts, .tsx, and .d.ts) over the Node's resolution logic.\nTypeScript will also use a field in package.json named \"types\" to mirror the purpose of \"main\" - the compiler will use it to find the \"main\" definition file to consult.\nFor example, an import statement like import { b } from \"./moduleB\" in  /root/src/moduleA.ts would result in attempting the following locations for locating \"./moduleB\":\n\n/root/src/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/src/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/src/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/src/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\nRecall that Node.js looked for a file named moduleB.js, then an applicable package.json, and then for an index.js.\nSimilarly a non-relative import will follow the Node.js resolution logic, first looking up a file, then looking up an applicable folder.\nSo import { b } from \"moduleB\" in source file /root/src/moduleA.ts would result in the following lookups:\n\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/src/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/root/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/root/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\n/node_modules/moduleB.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB.tsx\n/node_modules/moduleB.d.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a \"types\" property)\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.ts\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.tsx\n/node_modules/moduleB/index.d.ts\n\nDon't be intimidated by the number of steps here - TypeScript is still only jumping up directories twice at steps (8) and (15).\nThis is really no more complex than what Node.js itself is doing.\nAdditional module resolution flags\nA project source layout sometimes does not match that of the output.\nUsually a set of build steps result in generating the final output.\nThese include compiling .ts files into .js, and copying dependencies from different source locations to a single output location.\nThe net result is that modules at runtime may have different names than the source files containing their definitions.\nOr module paths in the final output may not match their corresponding source file paths at compile time.\nThe TypeScript compiler has a set of additional flags to inform the compiler of transformations that are expected to happen to the sources to generate the final output.\nIt is important to note that the compiler will not perform any of these transformations;\nit just uses these pieces of information to guide the process of resolving a module import to its definition file.\nBase URL\nUsing a baseUrl is a common practice in applications using AMD module loaders where modules are \"deployed\" to a single folder at run-time.\nThe sources of these modules can live in different directories, but a build script will put them all together.\nSetting baseUrl informs the compiler where to find modules.\nAll module imports with non-relative names are assumed to be relative to the baseUrl.\nValue of baseUrl is determined as either:\n\nvalue of baseUrl command line argument (if given path is relative, it is computed based on current directory)\nvalue of baseUrl property in 'tsconfig.json' (if given path is relative, it is computed based on the location of 'tsconfig.json')\n\nNote that relative module imports are not impacted by setting the baseUrl, as they are always resolved relative to their importing files.\nYou can find more documentation on baseUrl in RequireJS and SystemJS documentation.\nPath mapping\nSometimes modules are not directly located under baseUrl.\nFor instance, an import to a module \"jquery\" would be translated at runtime to \"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js\".\nLoaders use a mapping configuration to map module names to files at run-time, see RequireJs documentation and SystemJS documentation.\nThe TypeScript compiler supports the declaration of such mappings using \"paths\" property in tsconfig.json files.\nHere is an example for how to specify the \"paths\" property for jquery.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\", // This must be specified if \"paths\" is.\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"jquery\": [\"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\"] // This mapping is relative to \"baseUrl\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPlease notice that \"paths\" are resolved relative to \"baseUrl\".\nWhen setting \"baseUrl\" to another value than \".\", i.e. the directory of tsconfig.json, the mappings must be changed accordingly.\nSay, you set \"baseUrl\": \"./src\" in the above example, then jquery should be mapped to \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery\".\nUsing \"paths\" also allows for more sophisticated mappings including multiple fall back locations.\nConsider a project configuration where only some modules are available in one location, and the rest are in another.\nA build step would put them all together in one place.\nThe project layout may look like:\nprojectRoot\n├── folder1\n│   ├── file1.ts (imports 'folder1/file2' and 'folder2/file3')\n│   └── file2.ts\n├── generated\n│   ├── folder1\n│

   \"*\",\n        \"generated/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis tells the compiler for any module import that matches the pattern \"*\" (i.e. all values), to look in two locations:\n\n\"*\": meaning the same name unchanged, so map  => /\n\"generated/*\" meaning the module name with an appended prefix \"generated\", so map  => /generated/\n\nFollowing this logic, the compiler will attempt to resolve the two imports as such:\n\nimport 'folder1/file2'\npattern '*' is matched and wildcard captures the whole module name\ntry first substitution in the list: '*' -> folder1/file2\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/folder1/file2.ts.\nFile exists. Done.\n\n\nimport 'folder2/file3'\npattern '*' is matched and wildcard captures the whole module name\ntry first substitution in the list: '*' -> folder2/file3\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/folder2/file3.ts.\nFile does not exist, move to the second substitution\nsecond substitution 'generated/*' -> generated/folder2/file3\nresult of substitution is non-relative name - combine it with baseUrl -> projectRoot/generated/folder2/file3.ts.\nFile exists. Done.\n\n\n\nVirtual Directories with rootDirs\nSometimes the project sources from multiple directories at compile time are all combined to generate a single output directory.\nThis can be viewed as a set of source directories create a \"virtual\" directory.\nUsing 'rootDirs', you can inform the compiler of the roots making up this \"virtual\" directory;\nand thus the compiler can resolve relative modules imports within these \"virtual\" directories as if were merged together in one directory.\nFor example consider this project structure:\n src\n └── views\n     └── view1.ts (imports './template1')\n     └── view2.ts\n\n generated\n └── templates\n         └── views\n             └── template1.ts (imports './view2')\n\nFiles in src/views are user code for some UI controls.\nFiles in generated/templates are UI template binding code auto-generated by a template generator as part of the build.\nA build step will copy the files in /src/views and /generated/templates/views to the same directory in the output.\nAt run-time, a view can expect its template to exist next to it, and thus should import it using a relative name as \"./template\".\nTo specify this relationship to the compiler, use\"rootDirs\".\n\"rootDirs\" specify a list of roots whose contents are expected to merge at run-time.\nSo following our example, the tsconfig.json file should look like:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/views\",\n      \"generated/templates/views\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nEvery time the compiler sees a relative module import in a subfolder of one of the rootDirs, it will attempt to look for this import in each of the entries of rootDirs.\nThe flexibility of rootDirs is not limited to specifying a list of physical source directories that are logically merged. The supplied array may include any number of ad hoc, arbitrary directory names, regardless of whether they exist or not. This allows the compiler to capture sophisticated bundling and runtime features such as conditional inclusion and project specific loader plugins in a type safe way.\nConsider an internationalization scenario where a build tool automatically generates locale specific bundles by interpolating a special path token, say #{locale}, as part of a relative module path such as ./#{locale}/messages. In this hypothetical setup the tool enumerates supported locales, mapping the abstracted path into ./zh/messages, ./de/messages, and so forth.\nAssume that each of these modules exports an array of strings. For example ./zh/messages might contain:\nexport default [\n    \"您好吗\",\n    \"很高兴认识你\"\n];\n\nBy leveraging rootDirs we can inform the compiler of this mapping and thereby allow it to safely resolve ./#{locale}/messages, even though the directory will never exist. For example, with the following tsconfig.json:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"rootDirs\": [\n      \"src/zh\",\n      \"src/de\",\n      \"src/#{locale}\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nThe compiler will now resolve import messages from './#{locale}/messages' to import messages from './zh/messages' for tooling purposes, allowing development in a locale agnostic manner without compromising design time support.\nTracing module resolution\nAs discussed earlier, the compiler can visit files outside the current folder when resolving a module.\nThis can be hard when diagnosing why a module is not resolved, or is resolved to an incorrect definition.\nEnabling the compiler module resolution tracing using --traceResolution provides insight in what happened during the module resolution process.\nLet's say we have a sample application that uses the typescript module.\napp.ts has an import like import * as ts from \"typescript\".\n│   tsconfig.json\n├───node_modules\n│   └───typescript\n│       └───lib\n│               typescript.d.ts\n└───src\n        app.ts\n\nInvoking the compiler with --traceResolution\ntsc --traceResolution\n\nResults in an output such as:\n======== Resolving module 'typescript' from 'src/app.ts'. ========\nModule resolution kind is not specified, using 'NodeJs'.\nLoading module 'typescript' from 'node_modules' folder.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.ts' does not exist.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.tsx' does not exist.\nFile 'src/node_modules/typescript.d.ts' does not exist.\nFile

'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'.\nFile 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts' exist - use it as a module resolution result.\n======== Module name 'typescript' was successfully resolved to 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'. ========\n\nThings to look out for\n\nName and location of the import\n\n======== Resolving module 'typescript' from 'src/app.ts'. ========\n\n\nThe strategy the compiler is following\n\nModule resolution kind is not specified, using 'NodeJs'.\n\n\nLoading of types from npm packages\n\n'package.json' has 'types' field './lib/typescript.d.ts' that references 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'.\n\n\nFinal result\n\n======== Module name 'typescript' was successfully resolved to 'node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.d.ts'. ========\n\n\n\nUsing --noResolve\nNormally the compiler will attempt to resolve all module imports before it starts the compilation process.\nEvery time it successfully resolves an import to a file, the file is added to the set of files the compiler will process later on.\nThe --noResolve compiler options instructs the compiler not to \"add\" any files to the compilation that were not passed on the command line.\nIt will still try to resolve the module to files, but if the file is not specified, it will not be included.\nFor instance:\napp.ts\nimport * as A from \"moduleA\" // OK, 'moduleA' passed on the command-line\nimport * as B from \"moduleB\" // Error TS2307: Cannot find module 'moduleB'.\n\ntsc app.ts moduleA.ts --noResolve\n\nCompiling app.ts using --noResolve should result in:\n\nCorrectly finding moduleA as it was passed on the command-line.\nError for not finding moduleB as it was not passed.\n\nCommon Questions\nWhy does a module in the exclude list still get picked up by the compiler?\ntsconfig.json turns a folder into a “project”.\nWithout specifying any “exclude” or “files” entries, all files in the folder containing the tsconfig.json and all its sub-directories are included in your compilation.\nIf you want to exclude some of the files use “exclude”, if you would rather specify all the files instead of letting the compiler look them up, use “files”.\nThat was tsconfig.json automatic inclusion.\nThat does not embed module resolution as discussed above.\nIf the compiler identified a file as a target of a module import, it will be included in the compilation regardless if it was excluded in the previous steps.\nSo to exclude a file from the compilation, you need to exclude it and all files that have an import or ///  directive to it.\n"},"pages/Declaration Merging.html":{"url":"pages/Declaration Merging.html","title":"Declaration Merging","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSome of the unique concepts in TypeScript describe the shape of JavaScript objects at the type level.\nOne example that is especially unique to TypeScript is the concept of 'declaration merging'.\nUnderstanding this concept will give you an advantage when working with existing JavaScript.\nIt also opens the door to more advanced abstraction concepts.\nFor the purposes of this article, \"declaration merging\" means that the compiler merges two separate declarations declared with the same name into a single definition.\nThis merged definition has the features of both of the original declarations.\nAny number of declarations can be merged; it's not limited to just two declarations.\nBasic Concepts\nIn TypeScript, a declaration creates entities in at least one of three groups: namespace, type, or value.\nNamespace-creating declarations create a namespace, which contains names that are accessed using a dotted notation.\nType-creating declarations do just that: they create a type that is visible with the declared shape and bound to the given name.\nLastly, value-creating declarations create values that are visible in the output JavaScript.\n\n\n\nDeclaration Type\nNamespace\nType\nValue\n\n\n\n\nNamespace\nX\n\nX\n\n\nClass\n\nX\nX\n\n\nEnum\n\nX\nX\n\n\nInterface\n\nX\n\n\n\nType Alias\n\nX\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nX\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nUnderstanding what is created with each declaration will help you understand what is merged when you perform a declaration merge.\nMerging Interfaces\nThe simplest, and perhaps most common, type of declaration merging is interface merging.\nAt the most basic level, the merge mechanically joins the members of both declarations into a single interface with the same name.\ninterface Box {\n    height: number;\n    width: number;\n}\n\ninterface Box {\n    scale: number;\n}\n\nlet box: Box = {height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10};\n\nNon-function members of the interfaces should be unique.\nIf they are not unique, they must be of the same type.\nThe compiler will issue an error if the interfaces both declare a non-function member of the same name, but of different types.\nFor function members, each function member of the same name is treated as describing an overload of the same function.\nOf note, too, is that in the case of interface A merging with later interface A, the second interface will have a higher precedence than the first.\nThat is, in the example:\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Animal): Animal;\n}\n\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;\n}\n\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Dog): Dog;\n    clone(animal: Cat): Cat;\n}\n\nThe three interfaces will merge to create a single declaration as so:\ninterface Cloner {\n    clone(animal: Dog): Dog;\n    clone(animal: Cat): Cat;\n    clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;\n    clone(animal: Animal): Animal;\n}\n\nNotice that the elements of each group maintains the same order, but the groups themselves are merged with later overload sets ordered first.\nOne exception to this rule is specialized signatures.\nIf a signature has a parameter whose type is a single string literal type (e.g. not a union of string literals), then it will be bubbled toward the top of its merged overload list.\nFor instance, the following interfaces will merge together:\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: any): Element;\n}\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: \"div\"): HTMLDivElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"span\"): HTMLSpanElement;\n}\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"canvas\"): HTMLCanvasElement;\n}\n\nThe resulting merged declaration of Document will be the following:\ninterface Document {\n    createElement(tagName: \"canvas\"): HTMLCanvasElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"div\"): HTMLDivElement;\n    createElement(tagName: \"span\"): HTMLSpanElement;\n    createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;\n    createElement(tagName: any): Element;\n}\n\nMerging Namespaces\nSimilarly to interfaces, namespaces of the same name will also merge their members.\nSince namespaces create both a namespace and a value, we need to understand how both merge.\nTo merge the namespaces, type definitions from exported interfaces declared in each namespace are themselves merged, forming a single namespace with merged interface definitions inside.\nTo merge the namespace value, at each declaration site, if a namespace already exists with the given name, it is further extended by taking the existing namespace and adding the exported members of the second namespace to the first.\nThe declaration merge of Animals in this example:\nnamespace Animals {\n    export class Zebra { }\n}\n\nnamespace Animals {\n    export interface Legged { numberOfLegs: number; }\n    export class Dog { }\n}\n\nis equivalent to:\nnamespace Animals {\n    export interface Legged { numberOfLegs: number; }\n\n    export class Zebra { }\n    export class Dog { }\n}\n\nThis model of namespace merging is a helpful starting place, but we also need to understand what happens with non-exported members.\nNon-exported members are only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace. This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.\nWe can see this more clearly in this example:\nnamespace Animal {\n    let haveMuscles = true;\n\n    export function animalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace Animal {\n    export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {\n        return haveMuscles;  // Error, because haveMuscles is not accessible here\n    }\n}\n\nBecause haveMuscles is not exported, only the animalsHaveMuscles function that shares the same un-merged namespace can see the symbol.\nThe doAnimalsHaveMuscles function, even though it's part of the merged Animal namespace can not see this un-exported member.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes, Functions, and Enums\nNamespaces are flexible enough to also merge with other types of declarations.\nTo do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has properties of both declaration types.\nTypeScript uses this capability to model some of the patterns in JavaScript as well as other programming languages.\nMerging Namespaces with Classes\nThis gives the user a way of describing inner classes.\nclass Album {\n    label: Album.AlbumLabel;\n}\nnamespace Album {\n    export class AlbumLabel { }\n}\n\nThe visibility rules for merged members is the same as described in the 'Merging Namespaces' section, so we must export the AlbumLabel class for the merged class to see it.\nThe end result is a class managed inside of another class.\nYou can also use namespaces to add more static members to an existing class.\nIn addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with JavaScript practice of creating a function and then extending the function further by adding properties onto the function.\nTypeScript uses declaration merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.\nfunction buildLabel(name: string): string {\n    return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;\n}\n\nnamespace buildLabel {\n    export let suffix = \"\";\n    export let prefix = \"Hello, \";\n}\n\nconsole.log(buildLabel(\"Sam Smith\"));\n\nSimilarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:\nenum Color {\n    red = 1,\n    green = 2,\n    blue = 4\n}\n\nnamespace Color {\n    export function mixColor(colorName: string) {\n        if (colorName == \"yellow\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"white\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"magenta\") {\n            return Color.red + Color.blue;\n        }\n        else if (colorName == \"cyan\") {\n            return Color.green + Color.blue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDisallowed Merges\nNot all merges are allowed in TypeScript.\nCurrently, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.\nFor information on mimicking class merging, see the Mixins in TypeScript section.\nModule Augmentation\nAlthough JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and then updating them.\nLet's look at a toy Observable example:\n// observable.js\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...\n}\n\n// map.js\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\nThis works fine in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn't know about Observable.prototype.map.\nYou can use module augmentation to tell the compiler about it:\n// observable.ts stays the same\n// map.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\ndeclare module \"./observable\" {\n    interface Observable {\n        map(f: (x: T) => U): Observable;\n    }\n}\nObservable.prototype.map = function (f) {\n    // ... another exercise for the reader\n}\n\n\n// consumer.ts\nimport { Observable } from \"./observable\";\nimport \"./map\";\nlet o: Observable;\no.map(x => x.toFixed());\n\nThe module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in import/export.\nSee Modules for more information.\nThen the declarations in an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.\nHowever, you can't declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation -- just patches to existing declarations.\nGlobal augmentation\nYou can also add declarations to the global scope from inside a module:\n// observable.ts\nexport class Observable {\n    // ... still no implementation ...\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n    interface Array {\n        toObservable(): Observable;\n    }\n}\n\nArray.prototype.toObservable = function () {\n    // ...\n}\n\nGlobal augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.\n"},"pages/JSX.html":{"url":"pages/JSX.html","title":"JSX","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nJSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.\nIt is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.\nJSX rose to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other implementations as well.\nTypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.\nBasic usage\nIn order to use JSX you must do two things.\n\nName your files with a .tsx extension\nEnable the jsx option\n\nTypeScript ships with three JSX modes: preserve, react, and react-native.\nThese modes only affect the emit stage - type checking is unaffected.\nThe preserve mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel).\nAdditionally the output will have a .jsx file extension.\nThe react mode will emit React.createElement, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a .js file extension.\nThe react-native mode is the equivalent of preserve in that it keeps all JSX, but the output will instead have a .js file extension.\n\n\n\nMode\nInput\nOutput\nOutput File Extension\n\n\n\n\npreserve\n\n\n.jsx\n\n\nreact\n\nReact.createElement(\"div\")\n.js\n\n\nreact-native\n\n\n.js\n\n\n\nYou can specify this mode using either the --jsx command line flag or the corresponding option in your tsconfig.json file.\n\nNote: The identifier React is hard-coded, so you must make React available with an uppercase R.\n\nThe as operator\nRecall how to write a type assertion:\nvar foo = bar;\n\nThis asserts the variable bar to have the type foo.\nSince TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, combining it with JSX's syntax would introduce certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in .tsx files.\nSince the above syntax cannot be used in .tsx files, an alternate type assertion operator should be used: as.\nThe example can easily be rewritten with the as operator.\nvar foo = bar as foo;\n\nThe as operator is available in both .ts and .tsx files, and is identical in behavior to the angle-bracket type assertion style.\nType Checking\nIn order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.\nGiven a JSX expression , expr may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a div or span in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you've created.\nThis is important for two reasons:\n\nFor React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (React.createElement(\"div\")), whereas a component you've created is not (React.createElement(MyComponent)).\nThe types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.\nIntrinsic element attributes should be known intrinsically whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.\n\nTypeScript uses the same convention that React does for distinguishing between these.\nAn intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.\nIntrinsic elements\nIntrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface JSX.IntrinsicElements.\nBy default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.\nHowever, if this interface is present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the JSX.IntrinsicElements interface.\nFor example:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n    interface IntrinsicElements {\n        foo: any\n    }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nIn the above example,  will work fine but  will result in an error since it has not been specified on JSX.IntrinsicElements.\n\nNote: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on JSX.IntrinsicElements as follows:\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n   interface IntrinsicElements {\n       [elemName: string]: any;\n   }\n}\n\n\nValue-based elements\nValue based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.\nimport MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nThere are two ways to define a value-based element:\n\nStateless Functional Component (SFC)\nClass Component\n\nBecause these two types of value-based elements are indistinguishable from each other in a JSX expression, first TS tries to resolve the expression as Stateless Functional Component using overload resolution. If the process succeeds, then TS finishes resolving the expression to its declaration. If the value fails to resolve as SFC, TS will then try to resolve it as a class component. If that fails, TS will report an error.\nStateless Functional Component\nAs the name suggests, the component is defined as JavaScript function where its first argument is a props object.\nTS enforces that its return type must be assignable to JSX.Element.\ninterface FooProp {\n  name: string;\n  X: number;\n  Y: number;\n}\n\ndeclare function AnotherComponent(prop: {name: string});\nfunction ComponentFoo(prop: FooProp) {\n  return ;\n}\n\nconst Button = (prop: {value: string}, context: { color: string }) => \n\nBecause an SFC is simply a JavaScript function, function overloads may be used here as well:\ninterface ClickableProps {\n  children: JSX.Element[] | JSX.Element\n}\n\ninterface HomeProps extends ClickableProps {\n  home: JSX.Element;\n}\n\ninterface SideProps extends ClickableProps {\n  side: JSX.Element | string;\n}\n\nfunction MainButton(prop: HomeProps): JSX.Element;\nfunction MainButton(prop: SideProps): JSX.Element {\n  ...\n}\n\nClass Component\nIt is possible to define the type of a class component.\nHowever, to do so it is best to understand two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type.\nGiven , the element class type is the type of Expr.\nSo in the example above, if MyComponent was an ES6 class the class type would be that class's constructor and statics.\nIf MyComponent was a factory function, the class type would be that function.\nOnce the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type's construct or call signatures (whichever is present).\nSo again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\n\n// use a construct signature\nvar myComponent = new MyComponent();\n\n// element class type => MyComponent\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return {\n    render: () => {\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// use a call signature\nvar myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();\n\n// element class type => FactoryFunction\n// element instance type => { render: () => void }\n\nThe element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to JSX.ElementClass or it will result in an error.\nBy default JSX.ElementClass is {}, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementClass {\n    render: any;\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  render() {}\n}\nfunction MyFactoryFunction() {\n  return { render: () => {} }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n\nclass NotAValidComponent {}\nfunction NotAValidFactoryFunction() {\n  return {};\n}\n\n; // error\n; // error\n\nAttribute type checking\nThe first step to type checking attributes is to determine the element attributes type.\nThis is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.\nFor intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on JSX.IntrinsicElements\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { bar?: boolean }\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'foo' is '{bar?: boolean}'\n;\n\nFor value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.\nIt is determined by the type of a property on the element instance type that was previously determined.\nWhich property to use is determined by JSX.ElementAttributesProperty.\nIt should be declared with a single property.\nThe name of that property is then used.\nAs of TypeScript 2.8, if JSX.ElementAttributesProperty is not provided, the type of first parameter of the class element's constructor or SFC's call will be used instead.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementAttributesProperty {\n    props; // specify the property name to use\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyComponent {\n  // specify the property on the element instance type\n  props: {\n    foo?: string;\n  }\n}\n\n// element attributes type for 'MyComponent' is '{foo?: string}'\n\n\nThe element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.\nOptional and required properties are supported.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface IntrinsicElements {\n    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number }\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // ok\n; // error, requiredProp is missing\n; // error, requiredProp should be a string\n; // error, unknownProp does not exist\n; // ok, because 'some-unknown-prop' is not a valid identifier\n\n\nNote: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a data-* attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.\n\nAdditionally, the JSX.IntrinsicAttributes interface can be used to specify extra properties used by the JSX framework which are not generally used by the components' props or arguments - for instance key in React. Specializing further, the generic JSX.IntrinsicClassAttributes type may also be used to specify the same kind of extra attributes just for class components (and not SFCs). In this type, the generic parameter corresponds to the class instance type. In React, this is used to allow the ref attribute of type Ref. Generally speaking, all of the properties on these interfaces should be optional, unless you intend that users of your JSX framework need to provide some attribute on every tag.\nThe spread operator also works:\nvar props = { requiredProp: \"bar\" };\n; // ok\n\nvar badProps = {};\n; // error\n\nChildren Type Checking\nIn TypeScript 2.3, TS introduced type checking of children. children is a special property in an element attributes type where child JSXExpressions are taken to be inserted into the attributes.\nSimilar to how TS uses JSX.ElementAttributesProperty to determine the name of props, TS uses JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute to determine the name of children within those props.\nJSX.ElementChildrenAttribute should be declared with a single property.\ndeclare namespace JSX {\n  interface ElementChildrenAttribute {\n    children: {};  // specify children name to use\n  }\n}\n\n\n  Hello\n;\n\n\n  Hello\n  World\n;\n\nconst CustomComp = (props) => props.children\n\n  Hello World\n  {\"This is just a JS expression...\" + 1000}\n\n\nYou can specify the type of children like any other attribute. This will override the default type from, eg the React typings if you use them.\ninterface PropsType {\n  children: JSX.Element\n  name: string\n}\n\nclass Component extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.children}\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// OK\n\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element\n\n  Hello World\n  Hello World\n\n\n// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element or string.\n\n  Hello\n  World\n\n\nThe JSX result type\nBy default the result of a JSX expression is typed as any.\nYou can customize the type by specifying the JSX.Element interface.\nHowever, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.\nIt is a black box.\nEmbedding Expressions\nJSX allows you to embed expressions between tags by surrounding the expressions with curly braces ({ }).\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(i => {i / 2})}\n\n\nThe above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.\nThe output, when using the preserve option, looks like:\nvar a = \n  {[\"foo\", \"bar\"].map(function (i) { return {i / 2}; })}\n\n\nReact integration\nTo use JSX with React you should use the React typings.\nThese typings define the JSX namespace appropriately for use with React.\n/// \n\ninterface Props {\n  foo: string;\n}\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.foo}\n  }\n}\n\n; // ok\n; // error\n\nFactory Functions\nThe exact factory function used by the jsx: react compiler option is configurable. It may be set using either the jsxFactory command line option, or an inline @jsx comment pragma to set it on a per-file basis. For example, if you set jsxFactory to createElement,  will emit as createElement(\"div\") instead of React.createElement(\"div\").\nThe comment pragma version may be used like so (in TypeScript 2.8):\nimport preact = require(\"preact\");\n/* @jsx preact.h */\nconst x = ;\n\nemits as:\nconst preact = require(\"preact\");\nconst x = preact.h(\"div\", null);\n\nThe factory chosen will also affect where the JSX namespace is looked up (for type checking information) before falling back to the global one. If the factory is defined as React.createElement (the default), the compiler will check for React.JSX before checking for a global JSX. If the factory is defined as h, it will check for h.JSX before a global JSX.\n"},"pages/Decorators.html":{"url":"pages/Decorators.html","title":"Decorators","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWith the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members.\nDecorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.\nDecorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of TypeScript.\n\nNOTE  Decorators are an experimental feature that may change in future releases.\n\nTo enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the experimentalDecorators compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n    }\n}\n\nDecorators\nA Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.\nDecorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.\nFor example, given the decorator @sealed we might write the sealed function as follows:\nfunction sealed(target) {\n    // do something with 'target' ...\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator in Class Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Factories\nIf we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory.\nA Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.\nWe can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:\nfunction color(value: string) { // this is the decorator factory\n    return function (target) { // this is the decorator\n        // do something with 'target' and 'value'...\n    }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  You can see a more detailed example of a decorator factory in Method Decorators, below.\n\nDecorator Composition\nMultiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, as in the following examples:\n\nOn a single line:\n@f @g x\n\n\nOn multiple lines:\n@f\n@g\nx\n\n\n\nWhen multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics. In this model, when composing functions f and g, the resulting composite (f ∘ g)(x) is equivalent to f(g(x)).\nAs such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:\n\nThe expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.\nThe results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.\n\nIf we were to use decorator factories, we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:\nfunction f() {\n    console.log(\"f(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"f(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nfunction g() {\n    console.log(\"g(): evaluated\");\n    return function (target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        console.log(\"g(): called\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass C {\n    @f()\n    @g()\n    method() {}\n}\n\nWhich would print this output to the console:\nf(): evaluated\ng(): evaluated\ng(): called\nf(): called\n\nDecorator Evaluation\nThere is a well defined order to how decorators applied to various declarations inside of a class are applied:\n\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each instance member.\nParameter Decorators, followed by Method, Accessor, or Property Decorators are applied for each static member.\nParameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.\nClass Decorators are applied for the class.\n\nClass Decorators\nA Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration.\nThe class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition.\nA class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a declare class).\nThe expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.\nIf the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.\n\nNOTE  Should you chose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype.\nThe logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.\n\nThe following is an example of a class decorator (@sealed) applied to the Greeter class:\n@sealed\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @sealed decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction sealed(constructor: Function) {\n    Object.seal(constructor);\n    Object.seal(constructor.prototype);\n}\n\nWhen @sealed is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype.\nNext we have an example of how to override the constructor.\nfunction classDecorator(constructor:T) {\n    return class extends constructor {\n        newProperty = \"new property\";\n        hello = \"override\";\n    }\n}\n\n@classDecorator\nclass Greeter {\n    property = \"property\";\n    hello: string;\n    constructor(m: string) {\n        this.hello = m;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(new Greeter(\"world\"));\n\nMethod Decorators\nA Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration.\nThe decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.\nA method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the method decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the method.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of a method decorator (@enumerable) applied to a method on the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @enumerable(false)\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can define the @enumerable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction enumerable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.enumerable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nThe @enumerable(false) decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen the @enumerable(false) decorator is called, it modifies the enumerable property of the property descriptor.\nAccessor Decorators\nAn Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration.\nThe accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor's definitions.\nAn accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\n\nNOTE  TypeScript disallows decorating both the get and set accessor for a single member.\nInstead, all decorators for the member must be applied to the first accessor specified in document order.\nThis is because decorators apply to a Property Descriptor, which combines both the get and set accessor, not each declaration separately.\n\nThe expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe Property Descriptor for the member.\n\n\nNOTE  The Property Descriptor will be undefined if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nIf the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.\n\nNOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than ES5.\n\nThe following is an example of an accessor decorator (@configurable) applied to a member of the Point class:\nclass Point {\n    private _x: number;\n    private _y: number;\n    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n        this._x = x;\n        this._y = y;\n    }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get x() { return this._x; }\n\n    @configurable(false)\n    get y() { return this._y; }\n}\n\nWe can define the @configurable decorator using the following function declaration:\nfunction configurable(value: boolean) {\n    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n        descriptor.configurable = value;\n    };\n}\n\nProperty Decorators\nA Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration.\nA property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\n\n\nNOTE  A Property Descriptor is not provided as an argument to a property decorator due to how property decorators are initialized in TypeScript.\nThis is because there is currently no mechanism to describe an instance property when defining members of a prototype, and no way to observe or modify the initializer for a property. The return value is ignored too.\nAs such, a property decorator can only be used to observe that a property of a specific name has been declared for a class.\n\nWe can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:\nclass Greeter {\n    @format(\"Hello, %s\")\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        let formatString = getFormat(this, \"greeting\");\n        return formatString.replace(\"%s\", this.greeting);\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @format decorator and getFormat functions using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst formatMetadataKey = Symbol(\"format\");\n\nfunction format(formatString: string) {\n    return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);\n}\n\nfunction getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {\n    return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nThe @format(\"Hello, %s\") decorator here is a decorator factory.\nWhen @format(\"Hello, %s\") is called, it adds a metadata entry for the property using the Reflect.metadata function from the reflect-metadata library.\nWhen getFormat is called, it reads the metadata value for the format.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nParameter Decorators\nA Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration.\nThe parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration.\nA parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a declare class).\nThe expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:\n\nEither the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.\nThe name of the member.\nThe ordinal index of the parameter in the function's parameter list.\n\n\nNOTE  A parameter decorator can only be used to observe that a parameter has been declared on a method.\n\nThe return value of the parameter decorator is ignored.\nThe following is an example of a parameter decorator (@required) applied to parameter of a member of the Greeter class:\nclass Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n\n    constructor(message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n\n    @validate\n    greet(@required name: string) {\n        return \"Hello \" + name + \", \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}\n\nWe can then define the @required and @validate decorators using the following function declarations:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nconst requiredMetadataKey = Symbol(\"required\");\n\nfunction required(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {\n    let existingRequiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyKey) || [];\n    existingRequiredParameters.push(parameterIndex);\n    Reflect.defineMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, existingRequiredParameters, target, propertyKey);\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyName: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let method = descriptor.value;\n    descriptor.value = function () {\n        let requiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyName);\n        if (requiredParameters) {\n            for (let parameterIndex of requiredParameters) {\n                if (parameterIndex >= arguments.length || arguments[parameterIndex] === undefined) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Missing required argument.\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return method.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n}\n\nThe @required decorator adds a metadata entry that marks the parameter as required.\nThe @validate decorator then wraps the existing greet method in a function that validates the arguments before invoking the original method.\n\nNOTE  This example requires the reflect-metadata library.\nSee Metadata for more information about the reflect-metadata library.\n\nMetadata\nSome examples use the reflect-metadata library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API.\nThis library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.\nHowever, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.\nYou can install this library via npm:\nnpm i reflect-metadata --save\n\nTypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators.\nTo enable this experimental support, you must set the emitDecoratorMetadata compiler option either on the command line or in your tsconfig.json:\nCommand Line:\ntsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata\n\ntsconfig.json:\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES5\",\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true\n    }\n}\n\nWhen enabled, as long as the reflect-metadata library has been imported, additional design-time type information will be exposed at runtime.\nWe can see this in action in the following example:\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nclass Point {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n}\n\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\nfunction validate(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor) {\n    let set = descriptor.set;\n    descriptor.set = function (value: T) {\n        let type = Reflect.getMetadata(\"design:type\", target, propertyKey);\n        if (!(value instanceof type)) {\n            throw new TypeError(\"Invalid type.\");\n        }\n        set(value);\n    }\n}\n\nThe TypeScript compiler will inject design-time type information using the @Reflect.metadata decorator.\nYou could consider it the equivalent of the following TypeScript:\nclass Line {\n    private _p0: Point;\n    private _p1: Point;\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p0(value: Point) { this._p0 = value; }\n    get p0() { return this._p0; }\n\n    @validate\n    @Reflect.metadata(\"design:type\", Point)\n    set p1(value: Point) { this._p1 = value; }\n    get p1() { return this._p1; }\n}\n\n\nNOTE  Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.\n\n"},"pages/Mixins.html":{"url":"pages/Mixins.html","title":"Mixins","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nAlong with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.\nYou may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like Scala, and the pattern has also reached some popularity in the JavaScript community.\nMixin sample\nIn the code below, we show how you can model mixins in TypeScript.\nAfter the code, we'll break down how it works.\n// Disposable Mixin\nclass Disposable {\n    isDisposed: boolean;\n    dispose() {\n        this.isDisposed = true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Activatable Mixin\nclass Activatable {\n

[Disposable, Activatable]);\n\nlet smartObj = new SmartObject();\nsetTimeout(() => smartObj.interact(), 1000);\n\n////////////////////////////////////////\n// In your runtime library somewhere\n////////////////////////////////////////\n\nfunction applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, baseCtors: any[]) {\n    baseCtors.forEach(baseCtor => {\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach(name => {\n            derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name];\n        });\n    });\n}\n\nUnderstanding the sample\nThe code sample starts with the two classes that will act as our mixins.\nYou can see each one is focused on a particular activity or capability.\nWe'll later mix these together to form a new class from both capabilities.\n// Disposable Mixin\nclass Disposable {\n    isDisposed: boolean;\n    dispose() {\n        this.isDisposed = true;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Activatable Mixin\nclass Activatable {\n    isActive: boolean;\n    activate() {\n        this.isActive = true;\n    }\n    deactivate() {\n        this.isActive = false;\n    }\n}\n\nNext, we'll create the class that will handle the combination of the two mixins.\nLet's look at this in more detail to see how it does this:\nclass SmartObject implements Disposable, Activatable {\n\nThe first thing you may notice in the above is that instead of using extends, we use implements.\nThis treats the classes as interfaces, and only uses the types behind Disposable and Activatable rather than the implementation.\nThis means that we'll have to provide the implementation in class.\nExcept, that's exactly what we want to avoid by using mixins.\nTo satisfy this requirement, we create stand-in properties and their types for the members that will come from our mixins.\nThis satisfies the compiler that these members will be available at runtime.\nThis lets us still get the benefit of the mixins, albeit with some bookkeeping overhead.\n// Disposable\nisDisposed: boolean = false;\ndispose: () => void;\n// Activatable\nisActive: boolean = false;\nactivate: () => void;\ndeactivate: () => void;\n\nFinally, we mix our mixins into the class, creating the full implementation.\napplyMixins(SmartObject, [Disposable, Activatable]);\n\nLastly, we create a helper function that will do the mixing for us.\nThis will run through the properties of each of the mixins and copy them over to the target of the mixins, filling out the stand-in properties with their implementations.\nfunction applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, baseCtors: any[]) {\n    baseCtors.forEach(baseCtor => {\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach(name => {\n            derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name];\n

single-line comments, and hold no special meaning.\n/// \nThe ///  directive is the most common of this group.\nIt serves as a declaration of dependency between files.\nTriple-slash references

For example:\n/** @type {number} */\nvar x;\n\nx = 0;      // OK\nx = false;  // Error: boolean is not assignable to number\n\nYou can find the full list of supported JSDoc patterns in the JSDoc support in JavaScript documentation.\nProperty declaration inferred from assignments in class bodies\nES2015/ES6 does not have a means for declaring properties on classes. Properties are dynamically assigned, just like in the case of object literals.\nIn a .js file property declarations are inferred from assignments to the properties inside the class body. The type of properties is the union of the types of all the right-hand values in these assignments. Properties defined in the constructor are always assumed to exist, where as ones defined in methods, getters, or setters are considered optional.\nAdorn property assignments with JSDoc to specify the type of the property as needed. For instance:\nclass C {\n    constructor() {\n        /** @type {number | undefined} */\n        this.prop = undefined;\n    }\n}\n\n\nlet c = new C();\nc.prop = 0;         // OK\nc.prop = \"string\";  // Error: string is not assignable to number|undefined\n\nIf properties are never set in the class body, they are considered unknown. If your class has properties that are only read from, consider adding an initialization in the constructor to undefined, e.g. this.prop = undefined;.\nCommonJS module input support\nIn a .js files CommonJS module format is allowed as an input module format. Assignments to exports, and module.exports are recognized as export declarations. Similarly, require function calls are recognized as module imports. For example:\n// Import module \"fs\"\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\n\n// Export function readFile\nmodule.exports.readFile = function(f) {\n    return fs.readFileSync(f);\n}\n\nObject literals are open-ended\nBy default object literals in variable declarations provide the type of a declaration. No new members can be added that were not specified in the original initialization. This rule is relaxed in a .js file; object literals have an open-ended type, allowing adding and looking up properties that were not defined originally. For instance:\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Allowed\n\nObject literals get a default index signature [x:string]: any that allows them to be treated as open maps instead of closed objects.\nSimilar to other special JS checking behaviors, this behavior can be changed by specifying a JSDoc type for the variable. For example:\n/** @type {{a: number}} */\nvar obj = { a: 1 };\nobj.b = 2;  // Error, type {a: number} does not have property b\n\nFunction parameters are optional by default\nSince there is no way to specify optionality on parameters in JS (without specifying a default value), all function parameters in .js file are considered optional. Calls with fewer arguments are allowed.\nIt is important to note that it is an error to call a function with too many arguments.\nFor instance:\nfunction bar(a, b){\n    console.log(a + \" \" + b);\n}\n\nbar(1);       // OK, second argument considered optional\nbar(1, 2);\nbar(1, 2, 3); // Error, too many arguments\n\nJSDoc annotated functions are excluded from this rule. Use JSDoc optional parameter syntax to express optionality. e.g.:\n/**\n * @param {string} [somebody] - Somebody's name.\n */\nfunction sayHello(somebody) {\n    if (!somebody) {\n        somebody = \"John Doe\";\n    }\n    console.log(\"Hello \" + somebody);\n}\n\nsayHello();\n\nVar-args parameter declaration inferred from use of arguments\nA function whose body has a reference to the arguments reference is implicitly considered to have a var-arg parameter (i.e. (...arg: any[]) => any). Use JSDoc var-arg syntax to specify the type of the arguments.\nUnspecified type parameters default to any\nAn unspecified generic type parameter defaults to any. There are few places where this happens:\nIn extends clause\nFor instance, React.Component is defined to have two generic type parameters, Props and State.\nIn a .js file, there is no legal way to specify these in the extends clause. By default the type arguments will be any:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        this.props.b; // Allowed, since this.props is of type any\n    }\n}\n\nUse JSDoc @augments to specify the types explicitly. for instance:\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\n/**\n * @augments {Component}\n */\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        this.props.b; // Error: b does not exist on {a:number}\n    }\n}\n\nIn JSDoc references\nAn unspecified generic type argument in JSDoc defaults to any:\n/** @type{Array} */\nvar x = [];\n\nx.push(1);        // OK\nx.push(\"string\"); // OK, x is of type Array\n\n\n/** @type{Array.} */\nvar y = [];\n\ny.push(1);        // OK\ny.push(\"string\"); // Error, string is not assignable to number\n\nIn function calls\nA call to generic functions uses arguments to infer the generic type parameters. Sometimes this process fails to infer any types, mainly because of lack on inference sources; in these cases, the generic type parameters will default to any. For example:\nvar p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { reject() });\n\np; // Promise;\n\n"}}}
